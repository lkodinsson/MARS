# Custom Archetypes

Archetypes are fundamentally a starting point for a character rather than a strict limitation of what the character can do and can be built manually by picking skills and talents. There are two types of archetypes: *generalist* and *specialist*. This type will determine what skill step each skill starts at in the archetype. Generalist archetypes have all of their skills start at adept (r6), while specialist archetypes will have one at practiced (r8), two at adept (r6), and two at trained (r4). If any of the chosen skills provide additional abilities like maneuvers and spells, then those must also be chosen during character creation.

After deciding the starting skills, you choose one or two starting talents that you meet the requirements for. You may either pick one talent that costs 10 experience, or two talents that cost 5 experience. If those talents require skills, then they must be of those chosen in the previous step. Standard archetypes typically pick talents with simple or relaxed requirements but custom archetypes do not need to be as limited, so long as those requirements can be met during character creation.

Finally, it is important to describe the archetype itself. The description should be short at only a few sentences and give guidance on what characters of that archetype have knowledge of, what actions they take, what their goals are, and in what circumstances they often find themselves in.

#### Example Archetype - Weapon Master

While many fighters are dedicated to their overall role in warfare and are trained in a broad skillset, weapon masters dedicate themselves solely to their weapons. Weapon masters are trained in both the use and creation of all weapons, but receive little to no training in matters of medicine or diplomacy. The role of a weapon master is singular and without rival.
