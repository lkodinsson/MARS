## Animal Familiar

You have an animal companion that you share a special bond with. It is easy to communicate with them, almost as if you can speak directly into each other's minds, and people likely find this at least a little bit weird.

## Arcane Bond

You have a special magic object that is yours, and yours alone. It could be a magical ring, sword, or even book. You have likely had this for most of your life as a family heirloom, or had it recently bequeathed to you. Some potential is likely locked away in this object just waiting to be discovered.

## Blind Sight

You cannot see with your eyes, but through special circumstances or a lifetime of blindness you have learned to "see" with your other senses. Light and darkness make no difference to you, but exceptional smells or sounds may "blind" you.

## Efficient Sleeper

You need to only spend half as much time as anyone else to get the same benefits of rest.

## Eidetic Memory

Things you have seen, especially written words, are permanently available to you and you will always remember them. This is particularly useful if those visual cues help you perform certain skills or abilities.

## Involuntary Transformation

You can transform in some way under circumstances which are at least occassionally outside of your control - whether than means you are a werewolf, or you happen to find yourself changing sex whenever you get covered in water.

## Necrovisitation

Whether intentional or unintentional, you can see and often speak to the spirits of the deceased. Likely you are used to this as a common occurence. As you find yourself casually conversing with the spirits you witness, others may assume you are just speaking to yourself.
