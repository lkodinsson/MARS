**Type:** Tactical  
**Specializations:** Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Standard

**Resist:** Agility (not grappled), Athletics, or Unarmed

Make an athletics or unarmed combat check against a target 1m away. Make this roll with advantage if you are behind the target. The target may resist with agility if not grappled. Otherwise, they may resist with either athletics or unarmed.

If the roll is a graze or better and you are not already grappled, become grappled with the target. Then, if the roll was a success or better, you may choose to either gain control of the grapple or have the target lose control of the grapple. If the roll was a failure, the target chooses instead. By default, participants start grappled without control, and may share the same degree of control.

While grappled, participants have their speed reduced to 1m, may optionally share the same space, and can only perform a limited selection of maneuvers and basic actions. As usual, any maneuvers not learned may still be [improvised](/Basic/PHB.md#improvising-maneuvers) by participants.

All participants can only perform the following actions and maneuvers: [*attack*](/Basic/PHB.md#attack), [*delay*](/Basic/PHB.md#delay), [*grapple*](/Basic/Maneuvers.md#grapple), [*push*](/Basic/Maneuvers.md#push), and [*trip*](/Basic/Maneuvers.md#trip). Participants who are in control may also: [*brandish*](/Basic/PHB.md#brandish), [*disarm*](/Basic/Maneuvers.md#disarm), [*knock down*](/Basic/Maneuvers.md#knock-down), [*move*](/Basic/PHB.md#move), and [*rise from prone*](/Basic/PHB.md#rise-from-prone). Additionally, as a free action a character who is control may release another participant who is not in control from the grapple.

Participants in a grapple all move together.

Only those who are are in control may attack with non-unarmed weapons. Unarmed attacks may be made even while holding a weapon. Weapons with the *large*, *two-handed*, or *versatile* features are too big to be used, even while in control. Attacks made by participants who do not have control are downgraded to a graze if they result in a success or better.

Attacks from non-grappled characters against grappled targets are made with advantage.

## Hard Parry

**Type:** Defensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Martial

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Reaction

While wielding a weapon that can deal slashing damage, instead of using deflection to defend against an incoming attack, use your combat skill adding your armour rating as a bonus. If using a weapon that has the parry feature, if it has parry r6 or less, add +1 to this roll. Otherwise, add +2. If the incoming attack grazes against your combat roll, it is considered a failure instead.

## Heavy Strike

## Penetrating Strike

**Type:** Offensive  
**Specializations:** Finesse, Ranged

**Stamina Cost:** 2  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Duration:** 1 Turn  
**Resist:** Fortitude (for reduced effect)

Make an attack with a weapon. If successful, make a medicine check to inflict sickness 3 upon the target, or sickness 1 if the target resists. This causes it to perform tasks worse and suffer loss of health over a short period of time. Whenever the duration of this effect is met, the target may resist the sickness. If they fail, they lose 2 health, otherwise they lose 1 health and reduce the degree of effect of the sickness by 1.

If this effect is applied to a target that is already effected by this kind of poison, the greatest degree of effect takes precedence.

This maneuver may also be performed to pre-apply a single use poison to a weapon that inflicts the same effect. Instead, just make a medicine check to pre-determine the difficulty to resist the poison.

Performing this maneuver can only be done with access to a pre-made poison, or materials that can be used to approximate a poison.

**Resist:** Willpower

## Push

**Type:** Tactical  
**Specialization:** Martial, Unarmed

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Swift

**Resist:** Athletics

Make an athletics check against a target within 1m. If successful, either move with that target in a straight line up to half your speed or knock back the target up to 2m away from you. If they can't be knocked back because there is not enough room, then deal damage as if grazing with an unarmed attack. You may also choose to do both, but if you do, this maneuver is performed one action speed slower.

If you are grappled with the target, you may release them from the grapple if you choose to move them away from you.

## Quick Reload

**Type:** Tactical  
**Specializations:** Ranged

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free

The next time you take the reload action this turn, it is one action speed faster. If reloading is an extended action, it takes half the amount of time instead. If reducing an extended action by half would make it shorter than or equal to six seconds, it becomes a full-round action instead.
