# Currency

There are various types of currency that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. Each setting genre or setting may have a named baseline currency, in addition to various other currencies. Baseline currencies between genres are fundamentally equivalent.

All characters start with 50 units of starting money which they can spend on starting equipment.

# Adventuring Gear

Most equipment that is found or used is considered adventuring gear. Each genre will have its own list of expected gear, but they are not limited to only the gear listed. In most genres you can expected a listing for things like clothes, food, and tools.

##### Table: Example Adventuring Gear
| Name | Price | Weight |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Backpack<sup>1</sup> | 3 | 1kg |
| Clothes<sup>1</sup> | 5 | 1kg |
| Food, rations (4)<sup>1</sup> | 0.8 | 2kg |
| Toolkit, small<sup>2</sup> | 10 | 2kg |
| Toolkit, large<sup>2</sup> | 25 | 5kg |

<sup>1</sup> All characters typically start with an assortment of gear. Most of it is to be expected, like clothes, a backpack, and some food. Tracking use of food and water is optional.

<sup>2</sup> Toolkits contain all necessary tools to perform certain skillsets or crafts. When you buy a toolkit you must specify the skillset or craft it is for, rather than simply its size. For example, small toolkits could be used for cartography, cooking, fletching, jewelry making, lock picking, sewing, woodworking, and writing. Some skillsets require a larger amount of tools, such as alchemy, engineering, pottery, smithing, and trapmaking.

## Goods & Services

Typically anything listed here is mostly going to be food or housing, but may also include costs of rare specicialized services.

##### Table: Example Goods & Services
| Name | Price | Weight |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| Drink, cup of coffee | 0.2 | ¼kg |
| Food, average | 0.2 | ½kg |
| Inn, average | 0.4 | - |

## Trade Goods

Anything specified as a trade good is much more genre or setting dependant. Substances and materials that have any kind of monetary value depend highly on the technology and capabilities of civilizations.

# Weapons

Weapons have several properties: *damage*, *critical bonus*, *type*, *weight*, and may have one or more *features*. Features provide special abilities to weapons to differentiate them from one another. Weapons deal physical damage in one or more types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. These are noted next to the damage that a weapon deals as single letters: *B*, *P*, or *S*. The type of physical damage that a weapon deals does not have any inherent mechanical difference, but may limit situational uses of the weapon.

Weapons are typically separated into different tables sorted by skill specialization or other categories. Names of weapons listed represent more of a group classification of weapons as opposed to a very specific weapon. In reality, various weapons of different names may be represented by a single weapon listing.

##### Table: Example Weapons
| Name | Damage | Crit | Type | Weight | Features |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Unarmed | STR B | +2 | Unarmed | - | Nonlethal, Swift |
| Club | STR+r6 B | +6 | Basic | 1kg | Momentum, Swift |
| Shortbow | STR+r6 P | +8 | Ranged | 1½kg | Ranged 25m/250m, Two-Handed |
| Staff | STR+r6 B | +6 | Basic | 2kg | Backswing, Trip, Versatile |
| Straight Sword | STR+r6 P/S | +6 | Finesse/Martial | 1kg | Parry r6, Swift |

## Improvised Weapons

Any object can be used as an improvised weapon, including other weapons. Objects that are similar enough to a normal weapon use the stats for that weapon, but have -1 to hit and damage. For other objects use the following table:

##### Table: Improvised Weapons
| Name | Damage | Crit | Type | Features |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Coin or Stone | STR+r2 B | +6 | Finesse/Ranged | Swift, Thrown 3m/40m |
| Shield or Dish | STR+r6 B | +6 | Martial/Unarmed | Thrown 3m/30m |
| Glass or Vial | STR+r2 B | +10 | Finesse/Ranged | Thrown 3m/30m |

Additionally, any weapon or object can also be thrown as if it has *Thrown 2m/20m*.

## Weapon Features

**Backswing** If you miss with this weapon, your next attack with it during the same turn gets a +2 bonus to hit (in addition to the multiple attack penalty). This bonus stacks until an attack hits.

**Bypass** Attacks made have a reduced threshold to get a critical equal to the given value.

**Cleave** Additional attacks made against new targets don’t suffer from the multiple attack penalty.

**Large** This weapon is treated as being unfit at 1m, but also is too large to make attacks while next to walls, ceilings, or obstacles within 1m (or more if they have the unfit feature). If used within a 1m range of friendly characters, you have a chance to hit them instead if you fail to hit your target (roll an attack with disadvantage to hit a random adjacent ally).

**Mechanical** This weapon does not add strength to damage, and can be preloaded before attacking with it.

**Momentum** This weapon gets +2 to damage against targets you have already hit during the same turn, including hits made with other weapons.

**Nonlethal** Enemies knocked unconscious by this weapon do not start dying unless severely injured (brought to negative health equal to their maximum health).

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your Deflection.

**Ranged** Attacks made work normally up to the first given range. Attacks beyond that range get -1 to hit for each additional multiple of that range between you and the target. Attacks can only be made up to a maximum of the second given range. If only one range paramter is given, then that is also the maximum range. If used within a 1m range of friendly characters, you have a chance to hit them instead if you fail to hit your target (roll an attack with disadvantage to hit a random adjacent ally).

**Reach** Functions like the ranged feature, but attacks are still considered melee.

**Reload** Attacks can only be made by first taking the time to reload the weapon (as specified). Reloading the weapon in this way requires the use of both hands.

**Swift** Additional attacks made with this weapon have their multiple attack penalty reduced by 1 (from -4 to -3).

**Thrown** Attacks can be made as if they were ranged, but the weapon must then be retrieved after use.

**Trip** Attacks with this weapon can be made as a standard action that costs 1 stamina. That attack deals blunt damage, is made with -2 to hit, and deals half damage. If successful, the target can use agility to resist being tripped or drop prone.

**Two-Handed (melee)** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage. Attacks made single-handed get -1 to hit, and a disadvantage to damage.

**Two-Handed (ranged)** Attacks must be made with two hands. If the weapon is not mechanical it will also get an advantage to damage.

**Unfit** Attacks made at the given range or closer get -2 to hit.

**Versatile (melee)** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage and -1 to hit. Attacks made single-handed are made normally.

**Versatile (ranged)** Attacks may be made single handed with a -2 to hit. Attacks made two-handed are made normally. If the weapon is not mechanical it will also get an advantage to damage.

# Armour

Armour has several properties: *armour rating*, *damage reduction*, *strength requirement*, *armour slot*, *material type*, *weight*, and may have one or more *features*. Most features of armour are drawbacks of their design, but some of them provide bonuses. The type of material that an armour is made of does not have any inherent mechanical difference, but may by situationally relevant. The difference between most armours is a statistical increase in effectiveness. Typically as armours get more powerful they get heavier and may have minor drawbacks like being noisy.

Although armours listed here are named by weight categories, actual armours in equipment lists will have more descriptive names.

##### Table: Example Body Armours
| Name | AR | DR | STR Req | Armour<br/>Slot | Weight |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Very-Light | 1 | 2 | 4 | Body | 4kg |
| Light | 2 | 2 | 6 | Body | 6kg |
| Medium-Light | 2 | 3 | 8 | Body | 8kg |
| Medium | 3 | 3 | 10 | Body | 10kg |
| Medium-Heavy | 3 | 4 | 12 | Body | 13kg |
| Heavy | 4 | 4 | 14 | Body | 16kg |
| Very-Heavy | 4 | 5 | 16 | Body | 20kg |

In addition to body armours, additional armour pieces designed to cover the rest of the body can also we worn. These pieces of armour are the easier way to get increases to armour rating and damage reduction, but may take up one or more body parts or restrict vision and movement.

##### Table: Example Additional Armours
| Name | AR | DR | Armour<br/>Slot | Weight |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Light Limb Armour | 1 | - | Head<br/>or Arms<br/>or Legs | 1kg |
| Heavy Limb Armour | 1 | 1 | Head<br/>or Arms<br/>or Legs | 2kg |

## Shields

Shields are a special type of armour either held in the hand, strapped to the arm, or strapped to the shoulder. They are designed to provide substantial defense for a limited time, by actively parrying or blocking with them. Some shields may also provide a bonus to armour rating even while not actively blocking with them, so long as they are not broken.

If they are strapped to the arm or shoulder, they allow the use of that arm's hand to interact with your own equipment or for two-handing weapons, but otherwise cannot be used to make attacks or perform complex interactions. Shields require the use of other hand to apply or remove the strapping.

##### Table: Example Shields
| Name | AR | STR Req | Weight | Features |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Parrying Shield | - | 8 | 2kg | Parry r10 |
| Light Hybrid Shield | - | 10 | 3kg | Parry r6, Block 3, Durability 10 |
| Heavy Hybrid Shield | 1 | 12 | 5kg | Parry r4, Block 4, Durability 12 |
| Blocking Shield | 1 | 14 | 8kg | Block 5, Durability 15 |

## Armour Features

**Block** When you use this item to perform a block action, the amount of damage dealt to the shield is reduced by this amount.

**Critical Defense** Increase the threshold required to land a critical hit against you from an attack by 1.

**Durability** This item is capable of absorbing a limited amount of damage as specified. Items with spent durability must be repaired to recover their durability. An item with zero durability is considered broken, and cannot be used until repaired.

**Guiding** Attacks with ranged weapons can be made at a distance of two range degrees before suffering any penalties from range.

**Identity Obscuring** Depending on the degree that your face is obscured it is a challenge for others to discern your identity.

**Limited Vision** You have a disadvantage to perception.

**Locking Grip** You have advantage against attempts to disarm.

**Noisy** Wearing any amount of noisy armour gives you disadvantage to agility while attempting to move silently.

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your deflection.

# Equipment Properties

Various types of equipment can also be given various properties making them better or worse. Equipment may have multiple types of properties simultaneously, modifying one or more of their statistics.

Properties effect different types of equipment differently, and are limited to only those as specified below.

##### Table: Equipment Quality Properties
| Name | Cost<br/>Adjustment | Weapons | Body Armour | Shields |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Improvised | ×½ | -1 to hit and damage | -1 to AR and DR | -4 to durability |
| Crude | ×¾ | -1 to hit | -1 to AR | -2 to durability |
| Fine | ×2 or +10<sup>1</sup> | +1 to hit | +1 to AR | +2 to durability |
| Superior | ×3 or +40<sup>1</sup> | +1 to hit and damage | +1 to AR and DR | +4 to durability |
| Exceptional | ×6 or +150<sup>1</sup> | +2 to hit, +1 to damage | +2 to AR, +1 to DR | +6 to durability |
| Masterwork | ×10 or +360<sup>1</sup> | +2 to hit and damage | +2 to AR and DR | +8 to durability |

##### Table: Equipment Weight Properties
| Name | Cost<br/>Adjustment | Weight<br/>Adjustment | Strength<br/>Adjustment |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Heavy | ×¾ | ×1¼<sup>2</sup> | +2 |
| Light | ×2 or +10<sup>1</sup> | ×¾<sup>2</sup> | -2 |

<sup>1</sup> When property modifiers apply changes to cost, each property applies one of its two cost modifiers. The most expensive cost increases are always chosen, and then any cost reductions last.

<sup>2</sup> After multiplying the weight adjustment, round the weight to the nearest quarter.

When melee weapons have their weight adjusted it may also modify some of their features depending on which ones they start with.

##### Table: Melee Weapon Weight Adjustments
| Starting<br/>Features | Heavy | Light |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Swift | Versatile | Swift,<br/>+1 to hit |
| None | Versatile | Swift |
| Versatile | Two-Handed | Swift |
| Two-Handed | Two-Handed,<br/>-1 to hit,<br/>+1 damage | Versatile |
| Large,<br/>Two-Handed | Large,<br/>Two-Handed,<br/>-1 to hit,<br/>+1 damage | Large,<br/>Two-Handed,<br/>+1 to hit |

When ranged weapons have their weight adjusted it modifies them much more simply. Heavier ranged weapons get -1 to hit but +1 to damage, while lighter ranged weapons get +1 to hit.

##### Table: Example Modified Weapons
| Base Weapon | Properties | To Hit | Damage | Weight | Features |
|:-|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Club | Crude,<br/>Heavy | -1 | STR+r6 B | 1¼kg | Momentum, Versatile |
| Shortbow | Superior,<br/>Heavy | +0 | STR+r6+2 P | +8 | Ranged | 2kg | Ranged 25m/250m, Two-Handed |
| Staff | Fine | +1 | STR+r6 B | 2kg | Backswing, Trip, Versatile |
| Straight Sword | Exceptional,<br/>Light | +3 | STR+r6+1 P/S | ¾kg | Parry r6, Swift |

## Special Materials

Typically items are made of their standard expected materials, such as iron for most weapons and armour. If alternative materials are preferred, they can be used along with any relevant modifiers to weight or quality. Materials like copper, brass, or bronze could be used to represent heavy and/or crude equipment in relation to iron. Meanwhile finer steel alloys, or even fictional materials could be represented by lighter or higher quality equipment.

Most of the time, simply representing these materials by modifying the weight and quality is enough, but some materials may be more rare and valuable. This value may increase the cost of that item even if its properties are less than ideal.

For example: A pure gold sword would be useless as a weapon, being heavy and improvised. Since gold is soft it would likely also completely break if used. However, as a solid piece of gold or as a piece of art it might have a substantial value anyway.

For materials of this nature, the value of the item can be further modified by the perceived category of value of that material.

##### Table: Equipment Special Materials
| Value Name | Cost<br/>Adjustment | Examples |
|:-|:-:|
| Common | - | Aluminum, Bone, Brass,<br/>Bronze, Copper, Iron,<br/>Nickel, Pewter, Steel,<br/>Stone, Tin, Wood, Zinc |
| Uncommon | ×2 or +10 | Lead, Silvered Steel |
| Rare | ×3 or +40 | Silver, Titanium |
| Precious | ×6 or +150 | Electrum, Platinum, Rose Gold |
| Priceless | ×10 or +360 | Gold, Palladium |

Alloys of materials would be an equivalent value or one lower than the highest category of materials present, such as Rose Gold which is an alloy of Gold and Copper.
