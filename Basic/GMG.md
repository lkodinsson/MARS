# Worldbuilding

Being a game master means being in control of an entire world that players directly interact with. It can be a lot of work to both prepare and to actively run that world, especially if the players completely subvert your preparations. The following guide is designed to streamline the worldbuilding process, allowing that world to be played as soon as possible.

Each step in the worldbuilding process can be focused by the answering of several questions core to that step's proccess.

### Lore

### Scenarios

Scenarios are a complete statement representing a conflict or call-to-action for players. These can be complicated or simple descriptions of events that are happening in your world.

Example: A village is having their farms raided by nearby monsters, and they are in need of assistance if they are to continue feeding their population.

It is important in the framing of your scenario not to decide exactly how it will be resolved. This is an important distinction to remember, as players may surprise you in how they decide to complete or subvert your proposed scenarios.

Many scenarios can even be prepared in advance, allowing for the creation of storylines. This is massively beneficial because if any individual scenarios are subverted, there are at least others in the line that can still be used. Optionally, subverted scenarios can be repurposed for later use.

#### Scenarios: Questions

* What notable characters or objects exist that can provide more information for players?
* What are the consequences if the scenario is resolved with violence? What about diplomacy?
* Are there any other ways to resolve the scenario?
* Where can the players go if they completely subvert the scenario?

### Scenes

When players are actively engaging with the world and exploring the scenario provided to them, they are considered in a scene. This is where players can engage with non-player characters to gather information, explore potentially dangerous areas, and enter into encounters with enemies. Scenes are expected to have their own challenges which, while being potential roadblocks, must all have solutions for the players to overcome. Although it can be nice to provide details to add depth to the world before your players, players will typically expect any details given to be given for the explicit purpose of intentional interaction.

Example: There is a room with a locked door. The players know that there is something behind this door they want. The door can be broken into, lock picked, or you can break into the room by climbing into the window from the outside. There is also a key to the door hidden in the room.

Most of this direct interactive content isdetermined by answers to the questions that help build a scenario, such as who can be asked for information and what information they will provide.

#### Scenes: Questions

* Where is the scene taking place?
* Are there any details about the environment that are important?
* What are the consequences if the scene is resolved with violence? What about diplomacy?
* Are there any other ways to resolve the scene?
* How can the scenario progress if the scene is failed or subverted?

# Bestiary

EVERYTHING BELOW IS OUTDATED

The bestiary is a collection of various pre-generated non-player characters and creatures. It is useful for anyone who immediately needs stats for a character or creature and doesn't want to spend the time generating all their stats manually.

Creatures are given a description to use as a tool when roleplaying. Only characters who are likely to know the exact nature of a creature should be immediately aware of more specific details. Sometimes this is unavoidable for players very familiar with role-playing games. Other useful details are provided to help Game Masters with world building when using any given creature, such as habitat and behaviour.

Creatures are also given a list of stats and skills. It is important to note that unlike most other role-playing systems, slaying enemy characters and creatures does not award experience points, so experience rewards are not listed among their stats.

### Stat and Skill Ratings

Stats and skills are also be given *ratings*, which are approximations of the average value that stat or skill can roll. This is useful to save time when you need an immediate value to compare against, but don't want to spend additional time rolling dice (such as for a group of creatures). Ratings are listed before the actual value of a skill or stat, separated by a slash. They can be calculated by finding the maximum value that skill's dice and associated stat can roll, dividing that value in half, then adding any bonuses and or penalties.

Advantage and disadvantage on rolls can also be approximated: add a bonus or penalty equal to the number of dice they would have rolled.

### Creature Rarity

Creatures come in three rarities: *common*, *elite*, and *legendary*. By default the listed statistics for a creature represent their stats as if they were an elite. The stats of a given creature are different depending on their rarity, and take actions slightly differently.

Common creatures are simple, and easier to defeat in combat. Instead of tracking multiple resources for each of them, ignore all but their endurance. Have them become unconscious or dying (as it fits the narrative) when their endurance reaches zero. Since you are ignoring their stamina and focus, instead limit them to up to one or two uses of a maneuver or spells. This will allow you to more easily make decisions for those creatures without requiring that you track multiple statistics about them.

Elite creatures represent a more serious challenge to players, showing up in fewer numbers, and should use their abilities more frequently. Tracking their resources ensures that they meet this standard and are used fairly. Elites are usually the leader of a group of other common creatures.

Legendary creatures are basically bosses or lone creatures. They should be given double the amount of all their resources. If you want to make encounters with these kinds of creatures more interesting and unpredictable, you can choose to treat their stamina or focus as infinite, give them a bonus action on pivotal turns, or provide them with additional actions beyond their listed statistics. Try to utilize these kinds of bonuses within reason, as the goal is not to defeat the players, but to keep them guessing.

# Creating Creatures

Imagine how you would describe that creature, then assign values to its stats and skills based on your descriptions. Use the names of dice steps to help you decide what it should have. Because you are using description to determine the exact features of a creature, you don't need to limit yourself to normal character building or advancement rules. Do use them as a baseline so that they still function as you would expect from any other character. Try to avoid adding modifers directly to stats and skills, and use dice steps instead. If you do feel the need to manually add modifiers to stats, you can give them +1 to two stats, or +2, +1 and -1 among three stats.
