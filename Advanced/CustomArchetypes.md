# Custom Archetypes

Since archetypes are fundamentally a starting point, they are easy to design yourself.

You can choose one of two different archetype loadouts: specialized or generalized. In either case you will pick five skills, with at least two being basic skills and at least two being advanced skills. In a specialized loadout, one of those skills will be practiced (r8), two will be adept (r6), and two will be trained (r4). In a generalized loadout, they will all be adept (r6).

After deciding your starting skills, you choose one or two starting talents that you meet the requirements for. You may either pick one talent that costs 8 experience, or two talents that cost 4 experience.

It is also important to describe your archetype for story purposes. What is the primary focus and environment for your archetype? What are typical goals that someone of your archetype might have?
