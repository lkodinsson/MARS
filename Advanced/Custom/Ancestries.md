# Custom Ancestries

Rather than picking a predetermined ancestry to create a character with, ancestries can be built from the ground up to represent a mixed heritage or a unique culture. Although ancestries are completely customizable, it is recommended to keep them similar to existing ancestries that are already similar in theme or heritage. The game master always has final say in what is reasonable or appropriate.

Ancestries have several properties including: *stat modifiers*, *size*, *abilities*, *speed*, and *starting langauges*.

## Stat Modifiers

Modifiers to stats come in two forms: *balanced* or *specialized*. Most ancestries will usually have modifiers in a balanced form, giving +1 to two different primary stats. If a larger bonus is desired, a specialized form would provide a +2, +1, and a -1 among three different primary stats.

## Size

The default size is medium which provides no changes to any stats. However, custom ancestries may be designed to allow for a different size category. Any change in size then applies an additional modifier to primary stats. Custom ancestries are limited to these sizes: *tiny*, *very small*, *small*, *medium*, *large*, *very large*, and *huge*.

## Abilities

There are no default abilities for ancestries, and they are instead given 4 ancestry points to spend on abilities. Any ancestry points not spent are lost after the creation process.

Ancestry abilities can provide a large number of varying features that apply to all characters who share that ancestry. Most ancestry abilities are modifiers to stats, skills, or other abilities that mostly only work under special circumstances. Abilities that apply constant modifiers are usually more expensive.

## Speed

The default speed is 6m, which can be changed but at a cost of ancestry points. Speed can be increased to 7m at the cost of an ancestry point, or reduced to 5m providing an additional ancestry point.

## Starting Languages

All characters start with the langauge common, allowing all player characters to understand each other. Additionally, custom ancestries may start with any additional language or a custom language belonging to their ancestry.

While some ancestries may have abilities that do not allow their characters to physically speak, having the language itself does allow them to read and write, and understand when others are speaking.
