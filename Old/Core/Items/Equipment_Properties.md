# Equipment Properties

## Weapon Features

**Backswing** If you miss with this weapon, your next attack with it during the same turn gets a +2 bonus to hit (in addition to the multiple attack penalty). This bonus stacks until an attack hits.

**Bypass** Attacks made are treated as having an increase to their rolls to hit equal to the given value for the purposes of dealing a critical hit (they still need to at least hit normally).

**Cleave** Additional attacks made against new targets don't suffer from the multiple attack penalty.

**Large** This weapon is treated as being unfit at 1m, but also is too large to make attacks while next to walls, ceilings, or obstacles within 1m (or more if they have the unfit feature). If used within a 1m range of friendly characters, you have a chance to hit them instead if you fail to hit your target (roll an attack with disadvantage to hit a random adjacent ally).

**Mechanical** This weapon does not add strength to damage, but get always get advantage to damage (they are always treated as being two-handed). Ranged mechanical weapons can be preloaded before attacking.

**Momentum** This weapon gets +2 to damage against targets you have already hit during the same turn, including hits made with other weapons.

**Nonlethal** Enemies knocked unconscious by this weapon do not start dying unless severely injured (brought to negative health equal to their maximum health).

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your Deflection.

**Ranged** Attacks made work normally up to the first given range. Attacks beyond that range get -1 to hit for each additional multiple of that range between you and the target. Attacks can only be made up to a maximum of the second given range. If only one range paramter is given, then that is also the maximum range. If used within a 1m range of friendly characters, you have a chance to hit them instead if you fail to hit your target (roll an attack with disadvantage to hit against a random adjacent ally).

**Reach** Functions like the ranged feature, but attacks are still considered melee.

**Reload** Attacks can only be made by first taking the time to reload the weapon (as specified). Reloading the weapon in this way requires the use of both hands.

**Swift** Additional attacks made with this weapon have their multiple attack penalty reduced by 1 (from -5 to -4).

**Thrown** Attacks can be made as if they were ranged, but the weapon must then be retrieved after use.

**Trip** Attacks with this weapon can be made as a standard action that costs 1 stamina. That attack deals blunt damage, is made with -2 to hit, and deals half damage. If successful, the target can use agility to resist being tripped or drop prone.

**Two-Handed (melee)** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage. Attacks made single-handed get -1 to hit, and a disadvantage to damage.

**Two-Handed (ranged)** Attacks *must* be made two-handed and receive advantage to damage.

**Unfit** Attacks made at the given range or closer get -2 to hit.

**Versatile (melee)** Attacks may be made two-handed with an advantage to damage and -1 to hit. Attacks made single-handed are made normally.

**Versatile (ranged)** Attacks may be made single handed with a -2 to hit. Attacks made two-handed are given advantage to damage.

## Armour Features

**Block** When you use this item to perform a block action, the amount of damage dealt to the shield is reduced by this amount.

**Critical Defense** Attacks received are treated as having a decrease to their rolls to hit equal to the given value for the purposes of dealing a critical hit (it does not stop those attacks from hitting).

**Durability** This item is capable of absorbing a limited amount of damage as specified. Items with spent durability must be repaired to recover their durability. An item with zero durability is considered broken, and cannot be used until repaired.

**Guiding** Attacks with ranged weapons can be made at a distance of two range increments before suffering any penalties from range.

**Identity Obscuring** Depending on the degree that your face is obscured it is a challenge for others to discern your identity.

**Limited Vision** You have a disadvantage to perception.

**Locking Grip** You have advantage against attempts to disarm.

**Noisy** Wearing any amount of noisy armour gives you disadvantage to agility while attempting to move silently.

**Parry** When you use this item to perform a parry action, add the given value to your deflection.

## General Features

Various types of equipment can also be given various properties making them better or worse. Equipment may have multiple types of these properties simultaneously, modifying one or more of their statistics.

Properties effect different types of equipment differently, and are limited to only those as specified below. Each item may one only have one of each type of these properties (up to one quality and one weight).

##### Table: Equipment Quality Properties
| Name | Cost<br/>Adjustment | Weapons | Body Armour | Shields |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Improvised | ×½ | -1 to hit and damage | -1 to AR and DR | -4 to durability |
| Crude | ×¾ | -1 to hit | -1 to AR | -2 to durability |
| Fine | ×2 or +10<sup>1</sup> | +1 to hit | +1 to AR | +2 to durability |
| Superior | ×3 or +40<sup>1</sup> | +1 to hit and damage | +1 to AR and DR | +4 to durability |
| Exceptional | ×6 or +150<sup>1</sup> | +2 to hit, +1 to damage | +2 to AR, +1 to DR | +7 to durability |
| Masterwork | ×10 or +360<sup>1</sup> | +2 to hit and damage | +2 to AR and DR | +10 to durability |

##### Table: Equipment Weight Properties
| Name | Cost<br/>Adjustment | Weight<br/>Adjustment | Strength<br/>Adjustment |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Heavy | ×¾ | ×1¼<sup>2</sup> | +2 |
| Light | ×2 or +10<sup>1</sup> | ×¾<sup>2</sup> | -2 |

<sup>1</sup> When property modifiers apply changes to cost, each property applies one of its two cost modifiers. The most expensive cost increases are always chosen, and then any cost reductions last.

<sup>2</sup> After multiplying the weight adjustment, round the weight to the nearest quarter.

When melee weapons have their weight adjusted it may also modify some of their features depending on which ones they start with.

##### Table: Melee Weapon Weight Adjustments
| Starting<br/>Features | Heavy | Light |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Swift | Versatile | Swift,<br/>+1 to hit |
| None | Versatile | Swift |
| Versatile | Two-Handed | Swift |
| Two-Handed | Two-Handed,<br/>-1 to hit,<br/>+1 damage | Versatile |
| Large,<br/>Two-Handed | Large,<br/>Two-Handed,<br/>-1 to hit,<br/>+1 damage | Large,<br/>Two-Handed,<br/>+1 to hit |

When ranged weapons have their weight adjusted it modifies them much more simply. Heavier ranged weapons get -1 to hit but +1 to damage, while lighter ranged weapons get +1 to hit.

##### Table: Example Modified Weapons
| Base Weapon | Properties | Price | To Hit | Damage | Weight | Features |
|:-|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| Club | Crude,<br/>Heavy | 0.56 | -1 | STR+r6 B | 1¼kg | Momentum, Versatile |
| Shortbow | Superior,<br/>Heavy | 37.5 | +0 | STR+r6+2 P | +8 | Ranged | 2kg | Ranged 25m/250m, Two-Handed |
| Staff | Fine | 12 | +1 | STR+r6 B | 2kg | Backswing, Trip, Versatile |
| Straight Sword | Exceptional,<br/>Light | 310 | +3 | STR+r6+1 P/S | ¾kg | Parry r6, Swift |

## Special Materials

Typically items are made of their standard expected materials, such as iron for most weapons and armour. If alternative materials are preferred, they can be used along with any relevant modifiers to weight or quality. Materials like copper, brass, or bronze could be used to represent heavy and/or crude equipment in relation to iron. Meanwhile finer steel alloys, or even fictional materials could be represented by lighter or higher quality equipment.

Most of the time, simply representing these materials by modifying the weight and quality is enough, but some materials may be more rare and valuable. This value may increase the cost of that item even if its properties are less than ideal.

For example: A pure gold sword would be useless as a weapon, which can be represented by the heavy and improvised properties. Since gold is soft it would likely also completely break if used. However, as a solid piece of gold or as a piece of art it might have a substantial value anyway.

For materials of this nature, the value of the item can be further modified by the perceived category of value of that material.

##### Table: Equipment Special Materials
| Value Name | Cost<br/>Adjustment | Examples |
|:-|:-:|:-|
| Common | - | Aluminum, Bone, Brass, Bronze, Copper, Iron, Nickel, Pewter, Steel, Stone, Tin, Wood, Zinc |
| Uncommon | ×2 or +10 | Lead, Silvered Steel |
| Rare | ×3 or +40 | Silver, Titanium |
| Precious | ×6 or +150 | Electrum, Platinum, Rose Gold |
| Priceless | ×10 or +360 | Gold, Palladium |

Alloys of materials would be an equivalent value or one lower than the highest category of materials present, such as Rose Gold which is an alloy of Gold and Copper.
