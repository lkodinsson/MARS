# Currency

There are various types of currencies that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. All of the values of items are represented by a cost in generic unit of money. Different currencies have a value relative to the generic unit of money which depends on the genre. In one genre the cost of an item may be measured in dollars ($) and in another the cost could measured in silver pieces (sp). Sometimes there may be additional currencies usable at the same time like nuyen (¥) or gold pieces (gp).

All characters start with 50 units of money which they can spend on starting equipment.

Glasses are optional, but free if your character has poor vision. Tracking use of food and water is optional.

<sup>2</sup> Toolkits contain all necessary tools to perform certain skillsets or crafts. When you buy a toolkit you must specify the skillset or craft it is for, rather than simply its size. For example, small toolkits could be used for cartography, cooking, fletching, jewelry making, lock picking, sewing, woodworking, and writing. Some skillsets require a larger amount of tools, such as alchemy, engineering, pottery, smithing, and trapmaking.

# Weapons

Weapons have several properties: *damage*, *critical bonus*, *type*, *weight*, and may have one or more *features*. Features provide special abilities to weapons to differentiate them from one another. Weapons deal physical damage in one or more types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. These are noted next to the damage that a weapon deals as single letters: *B*, *P*, or *S*. The type of physical damage that a weapon deals does not have any inherent mechanical difference, but may limit situational uses of the weapon.

Weapons are separated into different tables sorted by skill specialization and other categories. Names of weapons listed represent more of a group classification of weapons as opposed to a very specific weapon. In reality, various weapons of different names may be represented by a single weapon listing.

# Armour

Armour has several properties: *armour rating*, *damage reduction*, *strength requirement*, *armour slot*, *material type*, *weight*, and may have one or more *features*. The type of material that an armour is made of does not have any inherent mechanical difference, but may by situationally relevant. The difference between most armours is a statistical increase in effectiveness. Typically as armours get more powerful they get heavier and may have minor drawbacks like being noisy.
