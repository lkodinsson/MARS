Lizardfolk live for extended periods of time and can recover quickly from injuries, which provides their civilizations with a greater concentration of surviving elders. As a result lizardfolk find a greater comfort in the wisdom of their own elders than seeking insight from other races.

Additionally, if they would be magically repaired such as by the mend spell, they always recover at least 1 health.

The machina also gets natural armour as a part of its body, which can be modified like any other armour, or replaced by any other metal armour type. This natural armour only applies its armour rating or damage reduction if that value is better than any body armour that the machina wears.
