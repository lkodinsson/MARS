## Artificer

Artificers are gifted craftspersons that are capable of inventing all kinds of devices with the assistance of magic. Some of these devices they use themselves, but some artificers prefer to craft solely to witness others benefit from their inventions.

**Skills** [Wizardry (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#wizardry-int) (r6), [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) or [Knowledge](/Core/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Craft](/Core/PHB.md#craft-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6), [Sleight](/Core/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r6)  
**Spells** Artificers start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Arcane Synthesis (Rank 1)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#arcane-synthesis)  
**Primary Stat** Artificers must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Assassin

Rogues may have a bad reputation in some circles, but that's mostly the fault of assassins. It's not entirely without reason, however, as both assassins and rogues prefer to slink in the shadows. Assassins excel primarily at inflicting death. While this is true, they owe it to their medicinal knowledge. This type of knowledge allows them to prepare both poisons and antidotes.

**Skills** [Agility](/Core/PHB.md#agility-dex) (r8), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex) or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Sleight](/Core/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Assassins start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Ambidexterity (+1)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#ambidexterity)  
**Primary Stat** Assassins must start with a maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Bard

Bards, much like wizards, are educated and personable. Bards use cleverness and a sharp tongue to overcome challenges. Given the more well-rounded education and breadth of skill that a bard possesses, they might be considered a jack-of-all-trades. They are often a reasonable substitute when a specialist is unavailable.

**Skills** [Wizardry (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#wizardry-int) (r4), [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r8), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex) or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Knowledge](/Core/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Bards start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Bards start with one spell.  
**Talent** [Inspirational Charisma (+1)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#inspirational-charisma)  
**Primary Stat** Bards must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Berserker

While fighters might choose diplomacy, or paladins might seek to protect their allies, berserkers live for combat above all else. Berserkers can harness the power of pure rage in combat to deliver powerful blows and shrug off pain. Typically, those who might call themselves berserkers are those from more tribal militaristic societies, or those who engage in the sport of fighting others like gladiators.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Charimsa](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r6), [Martial](/Core/PHB.md#martial-dex) (r8), [Unarmed](/Core/PHB.md#unarmed-dex) (r4), [Wild Empathy](/Core/PHB.md#wild-empathy-res) (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Berserkers start with two maneuvers for martial, and one maneuver for unarmed.  
**Talent** [Rage (+2)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#rage)  
**Primary Stat** Berserkers must start with a maximum strength and a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Champion

While clerics can represent the full spectrum of the devoted, champions represent the militaristic strong arm of these ideologies. They are there to protect those they declare in need, primarly those who follow tenets resembling their own. They are often drafted as mercenaries to empires who show loyalty to their cause.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Faith (Any Militarist)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res) (r6), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Core/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Champions start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Champions start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Divine Axiom (Any)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#divine-axiom)  
**Primary Stat** Champions must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Cleric

Many people have a code they follow that defines who they are, but clerics make it a part of their life's work. Clerics are often guides and teachers. Despite the work put into their faith and those involved, they typically do not create their own following. They are more likely to gather a following in the name of whatever divine entity they believe in, rather than for themselves.

**Skills** [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r4), [Faith (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res) (r8), [Knowledge](/Core/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Spells** Clerics start with three spells, and one bonus spell (depending on their specialization).  
**Talent** [Divine Devotion (1/rest)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#divine-devotion)  
**Primary Stat** Clerics must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Druid

Druids are magic users that are in tune with the forces of nature. Druids are rare to meet as they are typically ascetics who abstain from civilization. While many of them do live in the wild, often disguised as animals, some of them do occasionally interact with other people. Sometimes this is just to maintain some form of diplomatic position, or to dissuade others from encroaching on nature.

**Skills** [Agility](/Core/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r4), [Animism (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#animism-res) (r8), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r4), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6), [Wild Empathy](/Core/PHB.md#wild-empathy-res) (r6)  
**Spells** Druids start with three spells, and two bonus spells: [Speak with Animals](/Fantasy/Spells.md#speak-with-animals) and [Animal Form](/Fantasy/Spells.md#animal-form).  
**Talent** [Wild Magic](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#wild-magic)  
**Primary Stat** Druids must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Fighter

No matter the reason, either to defend the weak, for honor, for glory, or for revenge, fighters are skilled in the arts of combat and warfare. Through the use of various combat maneuvers, fighters are vital to winning various conflicts of physical prowess. Although fighters are primarily combatants, they are also often skilled in the application of medicine and diplomacy.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r4), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Core/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r8), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Fighters start with three maneuvers.  
**Talent** [Extra Maneuver](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#extra-maneuver), [Toughness (+4)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Fighters must start with either a maximum strength or maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Magister

The might of the magister sits deep within their mind, for above all else a magister is educated. Magisters dedicate themselves to preparing for both the known and unknown. If there is a task that someone else cannot complete, the magister is likely to be capable of providing the means.

**Skills** [Craft](/Core/PHB.md#craft-int) (r6), [Knowledge](/Core/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r8), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4), [Sleight](/Core/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r4)  
**Talent** [Always Prepared (1/rest)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#always-prepared)  
**Primary Stat** Magisters must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Monk

Body, mind, and spirit are the domains of monks. Through meditation and constant martial discipline, monks are capable of asserting forces beyond what one might believe possible. Typically monks do not seek confrontation despite their ability to handle themselves in combat. The way of the monk is more about mastery of one's-self rather than mastery over others. This does not mean that monks are pacifists, however, as they will often defend themselves if given good reason.

**Skills** [Agility](/Core/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Core/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Unarmed](/Core/PHB.md#unarmed-dex) (r6), [Ki (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#ki) (r8), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r4), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Maneuvers** Monks start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Monks start with three spells.  
**Talent** [Meditative Rest (+2/+1)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#meditative-rest)  
**Primary Stat** Monks must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Ranger

Some people prefer to live among nature, where insight is a key component to survival and understanding. Survival in nature requires a keen eye and a sharp mind; those who call themselves rangers have a strong ability to solve puzzles or understand complicated mysteries and a personal association with nature. Rangers are often found acting as guardians or managers of a natural wildlife habitat.

**Skills** [Agility](/Core/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Core/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Wild Empathy](/Core/PHB.md#wild-empathy-res) (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Rangers start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Deduction](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#deduction), [Toughness (+4)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Rangers must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Rogue

The world is full of dangers and unknowns. Rogues live and breathe in the world of peril, prepared to fight back with sharp wits or sharp blades. They are particularly known for their ability to tamper with various devices, such as traps and locks. It is likely that they are great thieves and smugglers, but it wouldn't be safe to say it to their faces.

**Skills** [Agility](/Core/PHB.md#agility-dex) (r4), [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r4), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex) or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6), [Sleight](/Core/PHB.md#sleight-dex) (r8)  
**Maneuvers** Rogues start with one maneuver.  
**Talent** [Danger Sense](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#danger-sense)  
**Primary Stat** Rogues must start with a maximum dexterity of 11 or greater.

## Sorcerer

Sorcerers are like wizards in that they are known for their magic, but it is not a power they have learned from study. This ability to cast spells is innate and a major part of their personality. As a result, sorcerers are often outgoing and are highly sociable, even with animals.

**Skills** [Agility](/Core/PHB.md#agility-dex) or [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r4), [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r6), [Contacts](/Core/PHB.md#contacts-res) (r4), [Sorcery (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#sorcery-res) (r8), [Wild Empathy](/Core/PHB.md#wild-empathy-res) (r6)  
**Spells** Sorcerers start with three spells, and one of those spells is designated as a signature spell.  
**Talent** [Esoteric Will](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#esoteric-will)  
**Primary Stat** Sorcerers must start with a maximum resolve of 11 or greater.

## Theurge

Theurges are powerful spellcasters dedicated to the pursuit of occult mastery. In addition to educating themselves on how to cast spells, they will also devote themselves to a higher power to acquire more spellcasting ability. Theurges believe they are more powerful than other spellcasters, but due to their higher rate of seclusion in the pursuit of eldritch knowledge, they are also typically lesser known.

**Skills** [Wizardry (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#wizardry-int) (r8), [Faith (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res) (r6), [Knowledge](/Core/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r4), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Spells** Theurges start with three spells in wizardry, two spells in faith, and one bonus spell in faith (depending on their specialization).  
**Talent** [Metamagic (Any)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#metamagic)  
**Primary Stat** Theurges must start with a maximum intelligence or maximum resolve of 13 or greater.

## Warmage

Where fighters might represent more varied martial roles, warmages are trained more specifically for war. Empires prefer to employ warmages due to their affiliation with the military, rather than wizards who are more likely to seek their own interests. While warmages lack the diplomatic tact of their fighter counterparts, they are still capable of administering general medicine.

**Skills** [Athletics](/Core/PHB.md#athletics-str) (r6), [Wizardry (Enchantment or Transmutation)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#wizardry-int) (r6), [Finesse](/Core/PHB.md#finesse-dex), [Martial](/Core/PHB.md#martial-dex), or [Ranged](/Core/PHB.md#ranged-dex) (r6), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r6)  
**Maneuvers** Warmages start with one maneuver.  
**Spells** Warmages start with two spells.  
**Talent** [Eldritch Infusion](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#eldritch-infusion), [Toughness (+4)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#toughness)  
**Primary Stat** Warmages must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.

## Wizard

Although wizards are known for feats of magical performance and knowledge of ancient secrets, it is more than that. Wizards like clerics, are often guides and teachers; they are known because of their relationships with others. Wizards are often sought out by adventurers and normal folk alike to help them find a solution to their problems, even if magic isn't the required answer.

**Skills** [Wizardry (Any)](/Fantasy/Skills.md#wizardry-int) (r8), [Charisma](/Core/PHB.md#charisma-res) (r4), [Knowledge](/Core/PHB.md#knowledge-int) (r6), [Medicine](/Core/PHB.md#medicine-int) (r6), [Perception](/Core/PHB.md#perception-dex) (r4)  
**Spells** Wizards start with three spells.  
**Talent** [Arcane Precision (1/spell)](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#arcane-precision)  
**Primary Stat** Wizards must start with a maximum intelligence of 11 or greater.
