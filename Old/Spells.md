## Alter Size

**Specializations:** Enchantment, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Increase or decrease the size category of a creature or object, altering its Strength, Dexterity, and Speed. You may change the size an additional size category by raising the focus cost by 1 and spell difficulty by 4 for each size after the first.

Increasing the size of a creature increases its Strength by 1 for each size increase. Dexterity is decreased by 1, and an additional 1 for every two size increases after the first. Speed is increased by 1 for every two size increases.

Decreasing the size of a creature decreases its Strength by 1 for each size decrease. Dexterity is increased by 1, and an additional 1 for every two size decreases after the first. Speed is decreased by 1 for every two size decreases.

For example: If your target was Medium sized and you increased it to Huge (three size increases) it would get +3 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +1 Speed. This would cost 2 additional focus (4 total) with an increased difficulty of 8 (23 total).

##### Table: Alter Size Modifiers
| Size<br/>Change | Focus<br/>Cost | Spell<br/>Difficulty | Strength | Dexterity | Speed |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| +5 Sizes | +4 | +16 | +5 | -3 | +2 |
| +4 Sizes | +3 | +12 | +4 | -2 | +2 |
| +3 Sizes | +2 | +8 | +3 | -2 | +1 |
| +2 Sizes | +1 | +4 | +2 | -1 | +1 |
| +1 Size | - | - | +1 | -1 | - |
| -1 Size | - | - | -1 | +1 | - |
| -2 Sizes | +1 | +4 | -2 | +1 | -1 |
| -3 Sizes | +2 | +8 | -3 | +2 | -1 |
| -4 Sizes | +3 | +12 | -4 | +2 | -2 |
| -5 Sizes | +4 | +16 | -5 | +3 | -2 |

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, applying one size category change less (to a minimum of one size category).

## Animal Form

**Specializations:** Animism (Bonus: Practiced (r8))  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 24 hours (concentration)

You take the form of any animal you can imagine. Specifically, you transform into any beast type creature. For each size category that beast has in difference to yours, increase the focus cost of this spell by 1 and the difficulty by 2. Additionally, if that creature is a magical beast, treat that as an additional difference in size in terms of calculating the cost and difficulty.

For example: If you are a Medium sized creature and you wanted to transform into a bear, which is a Very Large beast, it would cost you 4 focus with a difficulty of 14.

While transformed, your physical primary stats (Strength and Dexterity) temporarily become that of the chosen beast. Since this is a temporary change, your resource stats are not affected, but you will use your transformed Strength and Dexterity values when making rolls (such as when rolling deflection, evasion, fortitude, and willpower).

Additionally, you acquire any natural weapons, abilities (but not talents), and even movement speed that beast might have. While in this form your physical equipment still exists and can still provide magical effects from attunement, but you are otherwise no longer considered to have your weapons and armour equipped.

For example: If you transformed into a bear, this would change your strength to r16+3 and your dexterity to r14-1, even if they were higher. Your movement speed would also change to 14m.

As an animal you lose the ability to speak normally and cast other spells. You may still speak to other animals that are similar to you and cast this spell to transform directly into other animals. Casting this spell in this way is treated as if casting it from your normal form.

<!--***Critical:*** You maintain the ability to speak normally and cast other spells while transformed. Additionally, this spell does no longer requires concentration to be maintained.-->
***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, with a -2 penalty to the transformed physical stats.

## Arcane Missiles

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Evocation  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 20m  
**Target:** One or more creatures or objects  
**Resist:** Deflection (for half damage)

You shoot one to three arcane missiles which each deal arcane damage. Roll willpower plus 2, then divide the result by half to determine the damage of your missiles. These missiles *always* hit their targets, but deal half damage (again) if they graze or fail against a creature's resistance. If multiple missiles hit the same target, they deal their damage together as if it was one hit.

***Critical:*** Shoot three missiles.  
***Success:*** Shoot two missiles.  
***Graze:*** Shoot one missile.

## Bless

**Specializations:** Altruism, Family (Bonus: Adept (r6)), Harmony, Liberty, Light

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 10m  
**Target:** One creature

**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of purpose. They get a +1 bonus to all rolls. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of good fortune, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus. This spell and the curse spell cancel each other out.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell curse does on living creatures.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell cursing chant does on living creatures.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Curse

**Specializations:** Anarchy (Bonus: Adept (r6)), Authority, Darkness, Entropy, Militarism  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it unease and a feeling of a futility. They get a -1 penalty to all rolls. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of misfortune, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus. This spell and the bless spell cancel each other out.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell bless does on living creatures.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Cursing Chant

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Radius:** 6m  
**Target:** One object or surface  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (concentration, range of 30m)  

You touch an object or surface, causing it to consume nearly all light in a 6m radius. In a dark area like an unlit cave, the darkness is unnoticeable. Creatures who require light to see are treated as blinded while they are within the darkness. This spell and the light spell cancel each other out.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, with half the radius.

## Debilitate

**Specializations:** Air (Dexterity), Earth (Strength), Enchantment, Entropy, Fire (Resolve), Water (Intelligence)  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 6m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 12 seconds (until used) or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Choose a primary stat (strength, intelligence, dexterity, or resolve). That stat becomes debilitated (any rolls made using that stat have disadvantage) to target creature. This spell can be used with reduced duration and providing disadvantage for only one roll by reducing the focus cost by 1.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration. If the target succeeds or criticals any roll with the enhanced stat, the enhancement is lost.

## Detect Thoughts

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Light  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows you to read the active thoughts of another creature. You may also choose to read their deep thoughts and memories, but if you do, the target will know you are in their mind. The target may only resist the spell if they know that their thoughts are being read, and may do so at any time (once per round).

***Critical:*** Allows you to read deep thoughts without the target knowing.  
***Success:*** Allows you to read only the active thoughts.  
***Graze:*** Allows you to read only the active thoughts but the target will know what you are doing.

## Elemental Ward

**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Provide a creature with your choice of protection versus one of: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*. For the duration, all attacks of that type deal half damage after any damage reduction.

You may choose an additional type of protection by increasing the focus cost by 1 and the spell's difficulty by 5. This may even be done twice to allow protection versus up to three types.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Enhance

**Specializations:** Air (Dexterity), Earth (Strength), Enchantment, Fire (Resolve), Harmony, Water (Intelligence)  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 6m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 12 seconds (until used) or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Choose a primary stat (strength, intelligence, dexterity, or resolve). That stat becomes enhanced (any rolls made using that stat have advantage) to target creature. This spell can be used with reduced duration and providing advantage for only one roll by reducing the focus cost to 3.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration. If the target grazes or fails any roll with the enhanced stat, the enhancement is lost.

## Enhance Self

**Specializations:** Discipline, Genki (Strength), Kiai (Dexterity), Shouki (Intelligence), Yuuki (Resolve)  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 12 seconds (until used) or 5 minutes (concentration)

This spell functions exactly like the spell [Enhance](#enhance), but is faster to cast and can only be cast on yourself.

## Entangle

**Specializations:** Authority, Balance, Earth, Entropy, Harmony  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 20m  
**Radius:** 3m  
**Target:** One point  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Resist:** Agility (vs entanglement), Athletics (to break free)  

Plants in a 3m radius grow into spiny vines that begin to entangle all creatures in the radius. Any creature who starts their turn or steps onto or through the entangling area must resist using Agility or become entangled and take damage. Grazing against this effect allows the creature to avoid entanglement but still take damage. This effect occurs every time the creature attempts to move while still in the entangling area. Creatures that do not treat the entangling area as difficult terrain get disadvantage to their resist roll.

Entangled creatures cannot move unless they spend a swift action and make an Athletics check to break free. Failing to break free also causes the vines to deal damage. Grazing against this effect allows the creature to break free but still take damage.

***Critical:*** The vines deal 6 piercing damage.  
***Success:*** The vines deal 4 piercing damage.  
***Graze:*** The vines deal 2 piercing damage, last for half the duration, and with half the radius.

## Feather Fall

**Specializations:** Air, Discipline, Enchantment, Kiai, Liberty, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift or Reaction

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One or more creatures or objects  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration, landing)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Reduces the speed of a creature so that it falls slowly enough to always land safely. When used on weapons or ammunition in this way it doubles any range increments provided by the *ranged* or *thrown* features. All objects and creatures under this spell are essentially half their weight, making them easier to carry, and allowing them to travel twice as far in the air.

This spell's focus cost and difficulty increase by 1 for each additional creature and object you target.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and can only effect a single target.

## Fireball

**Specializations:** Evocation, Fire, Genki, Impulse, Kiai, Militarism  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 30m  
**Radius:** 4m  
**Target:** One creature, object, or point  
**Resist:** Fortitude (graze for half damage)

You launch a powerful globe of blazing fire toward a target where it erupts into a sweeping blaze in a radius of 4m, dealing fire damage and causing burning to all nearby targets. Creatures within half the radius that are not wet take an additional 4 damage and get burning 1. Creatures effected that are wearing cloth armour or just clothes get their resist roll redcued by 2. Wet creatures and objects get advantage to resist this spell, and if they fail they become dry and still only take half damage. This spell deals half damage if it grazes against a creature's resistance.

***Critical:*** Roll willpower plus 4 to deal fire damage and the creatures get burning 2, light dry objects on fire, and dry wet objects.  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to deal fire damage and the creatures get burning 1, light dry objects on fire, and dry wet objects.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to deal fire damage, and light dry objects on fire.

## Grease

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Water  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 10m  
**Radius:** 3m  
**Target:** One point  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Resist:** Agility (vs grease), Fortitude (vs ignition)

Creates a thin pool of slippery grease in a 3m radius. Any creature who starts their turn or steps onto or through the greasy area must resist using Agility or fall prone. This effect occurs every time the creature attempts to move while still in the greasy area. Creatures that do not treat the greasy area as difficult terrain get disadvantage to their resist roll. 

The grease can be ignited, which gives burning 2 to any creature who starts their turn or steps onto or through the greasy area. This burning effect can only be given once per turn and can be resisted with Fortitude (causing burning 1 instead). Ignited grease lasts half as long. The range and radius of this spell can both be simultaneously increased by 1m by increasing this spell's focus cost by 1 and difficulty by 2.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, with half the radius.

## Guidance

**Specializations:** Altruism, Balance, Evocation, Fire, Harmony, Impulse, Yuuki  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 minute (until used)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of intention. They get a +1 bonus to the next skill check they perform. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of advice, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and only provides the bonus to skills the target is at least trained in.

## Harm

**Specializations:** Balance, Darkness, Earth, Entropy, Genki, Militarism, Transmutation, Water  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One object or creature  
**Resist:** Fortitude (graze for half damage)

This spell can be used to destroy small mundane objects made of wood or stone, break a part of a larger object, or cause wounds to a creature. Creatures affected by this spell gain the dying effect if they have negative health, even if they still have positive endurance. This spell deals half damage if it grazes against a creature's resistance.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell mend does on living creatures.

***Critical:*** Roll willpower plus 4 to deal void damage and 1 bonus damage directly to health (this bonus damage cannot be prevented in any way).  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to deal void damage.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to deal void damage.

## Ignite

**Specializations:** Evocation, Fire, Impulse, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Resist:** Fortitude (graze for half damage)

You fire a small burst of flame at a nearby object or creature, dealing fire damage. This spell can be used to light flammable material instantly. If you target a creature with this spell that is wearing cloth armour or just clothes, reduce their resist roll by 2. Wet creatures get advantage to resist this spell, and if they fail they become dry and still only take half damage. This spell deals half damage if it grazes against a creature's resistance.

***Critical:*** Roll willpower plus 4 to deal fire damage and the creature gets burning 2, light a dry object on fire, or dry a wet object.  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to deal fire damage and the creature gets burning 1, light a dry object on fire, or dry a wet object.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to deal fire damage, or light a dry object on fire.

**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 20m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (until used)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of greater confidence. They get an advantage to the next skill check they perform. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking inspiring words, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and only provides advantage to skills the target is at least trained in.

## Jolt

**Specializations:** Air, Evocation, Impulse, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Resist:** Deflection (graze for half damage)

You launch a small pulse of electricity at a nearby object or creature, dealing electric damage. This spell can also be used to recharge or activate simple devices that use electricity. Creatures targeted by this spell ignore any armour rating they get from metal armour while attempting to resist this spell, but double the armour rating from any leather armour. Creatures that are wet get a disadvantage to resist this spell. If this spell targets a body of water, it effects all objects and creatures within 6m from the targeted point that are contained in or connected to that body of water. This spell deals half damage if it grazes against a creature's resistance.

***Critical:*** Roll willpower plus 4 to deal electric damage and the creature becomes stunned.  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to deal electric damage.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to deal electric damage.

## Knock

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Entropy, Light, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Extended (1 minute)

**Range:** Touch  
**Radius:** 10m to 60m  
**Target:** One locked object

You touch a physically locked object and it becomes unlocked. This spell works on all objects with physical locking mechanisms; it does not work on magically locked objects. When this spell is cast, regardless of success, it also creates a very loud sound. This sound is similar to a large hammer slamming into a door with intent to break it.

***Critical:*** Makes a lound sound in a 10m radius.  
***Success:*** Makes a lound sound in a 30m radius.  
***Graze:*** Makes a lound sound in a 60m radius.

**Radius:** 6m  
**Target:** One object or surface  
**Duration:** 1 hour (concentration, range of 30m)

You touch an object or surface, causing it to radiate light like a torch in a 6m radius. The colour of this light may be any colour of your choice. In daylight or a well lit area, the magical light is unnoticeable unless it has a specified colour (but still weak). Creatures who are sensitive to bright lights are treated as blinded while they are within the light. This spell and the darkness spell cancel each other out.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, with half the radius.

## Magic Armour

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Enchantment, Militarism  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You create a suit of magical armour on the target of your spell. It has an armour rating and damage reduction similar to armour, but it has no weight or strength requirements. Additionally, this armour is capable of reducing magical damage unlike real armour. If a character wearing the magical armour is also wearing real body armour, use whatever values are higher between the magical and real armour. Even so, the magical armour will always remove any weaknesses that the real armour would have, and still provides the ability to reduce damage from magic. It does not remove any other features of the real armour (such as the weight, strength requirement, or any noise it might produce).

***Critical:*** 5 armour rating and 7 damage reduction.  
***Success:*** 3 armour rating and 5 damage reduction.  
***Graze:*** 2 armour rating and 3 damage reduction.

## Magic Weapon

**Specializations:** Air (Electric), Arcane (Arcane), Darkness (Void), Enchantment, Fire (Fire), Light (Radiant), Militarism, Transmutation, War (Bonus: Adept (r6)), Water (Cold)  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One weapon  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)

You touch a weapon, granting it magical properties. It deals half of its damage as an elemental damage type of your choice (this means it bypasses half damage reduction, rounded up). Based on the chosen damage type, the weapon also applies an additional effect when it deals critical hits. The lethal parts of the weapon visually emanate a magical effect based on the elemental damage type chosen. If this spell is used on a ranged weapon that requires ammunition, that weapon will generate magical ammunition as the weapon is used or armed as appropriate.

***Arcane:*** The attacked target loses r4 focus.  
***Cold:*** The attacked target loses r4 stamina.  
***Electric:*** The attacked target becomes stunned.  
***Fire:*** The attacked target gets burning 1.  
***Radiant:*** The attacked target takes r6 more weapon damage if undead.  
***Void:*** The attacked target gets sickness 1 (lasting 1 week) if living.

***Graze:*** The weapon deals half elemental damage as normal, but provides no additional effect on a critical hit with the weapon.

## Mend

**Specializations:** Altruism, Balance, Charity (Bonus: Adept (r6)), Discipline, Earth, Harmony, Liberty, Light, Transmutation, Water, Yuuki  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One object or creature  
**Resist:** Fortitude

This spell can be used to repair any broken mundane objects, fuse two objects of a similar material, or treat superficial wounds to a creature. Creatures affected by this spell are automatically stabilized. This spell restores half as much if it grazes against a target's resistance.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell harm does on living creatures, but dealing radiant instead of void damage.

***Critical:*** Restore 1 health, and roll willpower plus 4 to restore endurance.  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to restore endurance.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to restore endurance.

## Mental Strike

**Specializations:** Air, Arcane, Augury, Darkness, Enchantment, Entropy, Impulse, Shouki  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 20m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Resist:** Willpower (graze for half damage)

You barrage a creature with a series of vicious words that cut deep into their mind dealing arcane damage and possibly interrupting concentration. If the creature does not understand the language you use, they get advantage to resist the spell. If this spell grazes against the target's resistance it deals half damage and does not cause it to lose concentration.

***Critical:*** Roll willpower plus 4 to deal arcane damage and the creature loses concentration.  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to deal arcane damage.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to deal arcane damage.

## Message

**Specializations:** Air, Augury, Enchantment, Liberty, Light, Shouki  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 3m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows you to speak a message (one or two sentences) telepathically into the mind of another creature. You may choose to allow them to respond. At any point the creature you communicate with may resist to not hear what you say to them (and end the spell), or resist to force you to listen to them. In any case, you may choose to allow a single message back and forth, or concentrate to allow for a longer conversation.

Communicating in this way does not guarantee an understanding. Creatures must also be able to speak the language in the received message in order to understand it. Optionally, messages can be sent in the form of a mental image. This improves the chance of an understanding, but it is not guaranteed.

***Graze:*** Only a single message may be sent back and forth, then the effect is lost.

## Physical Ward

**Specializations:** Discipline, Earth, Enchantment, Genki, Militarism, Yuuki  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 6m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Provide a creature with your choice of protection versus one of: *blunt*, *piercing*, or *slashing*. For the duration, all attacks of that type deal half damage after any damage reduction.

You may choose an additional type of protection by increasing the focus cost by 1 and the spell's difficulty by 5. This may even be done twice to allow protection versus all types.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Prestidigitation

**Specializations:** Arcane, Authority, Conjuration, Darkness  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 1m  
**Duration:** Instant or 24 hours (concentration, range of 30m)

You create the illusion of a miniscule object or creature, or various small magical effects (like sparks or flashes of light). This effect originates from a short distance nearby (usually within or near your hands). This effect can be made to interact with any of the senses, and can be felt to have a solid form, weight and odour. Any effects created are of an obviously conjured appearance. The illusion is not strong enough in form to be used for weapons or tools, but can be used to clean very minor messes like dirty clothes, or to apply an altered smell.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration (if not an instantaneous effect), and with half the range.

## Restoration

**Specializations:** Altruism, Genki, Harmony, Transmutation, Liberty, Light, Yuuki  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Duration:** Instant or 1 week (blindness)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You restore a living creature to good health, removing negative conditions of a mundane nature. While this spell cannot dispel magical effects directly, it can restore natural conditions caused by spells. The degree of success determines which conditions this spell is capable of removing, but only one condition can be removed at a time. Additionally, any creatures that have health restored by this spell are automatically stabilized. This spell can even temporarily cure blindness (for 1 week).

***Critical:*** Restore 2 health, and remove one of the following conditions: debilitation, sickness, sleep, burning, or blindness (1 week).  
***Success:*** Restore 1 health, and remove one of the following conditions: sickness, burning, or sleep.  
***Graze:*** Remove one of the following conditions: sickness, burning, or sleep.

**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Extended (1 minute)

Provides you with some information about any subject. Only information that can be determined within the next 30 minutes can be requested. Ask the Game Master a simple question (no longer than one sentence). You must ask this question from the perspective of your character.

***Critical:*** Receive a three word clue or a yes-or-no answer (Game Master's choice).  
***Success:*** Receive a two word clue.  
***Graze:*** Receive a one word clue.

## Shield

**Specializations:** Arcane, Conjuration, Enchantment, Militarism, Shouki  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Swift or Free Reaction

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration)

You create a magical shield that acts like a normal shield in that it has a block value and durability, but it has no weight or strength requirements. Because the shield is weightless, it floats next to you rather than occupying a hand.

While the shield is present, it can be used to block as a normal shield would, but you may spend focus instead of stamina to perform the block action with it.

If this spell is cast as a free reaction, it does not require concentration, but may only be used to block a single incoming attack. If so, it costs 1 less focus to cast, but will still cost an additional 1 stamina or focus to block.

***Critical:*** Block 5, Durability 15.  
***Success:*** Block 4, Durability 12.  
***Graze:*** Block 3, Durability 10.

## Sickness

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Darkness, Earth, Militarism, Transmutation, Water  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Resist:** Fortitude

Inflict sickness upon a living creature, causing it to perform tasks worse and suffer loss of health from long-term exposure. Whenever the duration is met, the creature may make a fortitude check to reduce their sickness by 1.

***Critical:*** The creature gets sickness 2.  
***Success:*** The creature gets sickness 1.  
***Graze:*** The creature gets sickness 1, but it only lasts 1 minute.

## Sacred Bond

**Specializations:** Altruism, Authority, Balance, Discipline, Harmony  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
**Resist:** Willpower

You form a sacred bond between yourself and a creature, allowing you to cast spells that require touch which target that creature but instead up to a distance of 100m away. This bond is not broken no matter how far away they are, but only lasts for a duration of 24 hours. While this spell does not require concentration, you may only have a sacred bond with one creature at a time.

***Critical:*** Lasts indefinitely, and up to twice the distance.  
***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and half the distance.

## Sight

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Balance, Discipline, Enchantment, Light, Shouki  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 24 hours (concentration, range of 30m)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows a creature to see, even if they are naturally blind, in any amount of light or darkness as though they could see with normal daylight vision. The sight of the creature adjusts naturally to any degree of light or darkness.

***Graze:*** It takes the creature 1 minute to adjust to the vision, and 1 minute to adjust to a change in light or darkness.

## Sight Projection

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Light, Shouki  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (concentration, range of 100m+)

You project your sight as though it is coming from another body. This effect begins where your body is, but can be moved around at a speed of 6m. You can move your body independently but it will be very difficult if you cannot see your body at the same time. This projection cannot pass through solid objects, but can pass through very tiny openings. This projection can be seen by those under the effect of the Sight spell, and appears as a tiny floating glowing eye.

The maximum range of this spell increases by 10m for every 1 your casting roll bypasses the difficulty, and reduced by 10m for every 1 it is below the difficulty.

## Sleep

**Specializations:** Authority, Darkness, Enchantment, Evocation  
**Spell Tier:** 3 (Greater)

**Action Speed:** Full-round

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One or more creatures  
**Duration:** 1 minute (combatants), 30 minutes (stealth), 8 hours (trying to sleep)  
**Resist:** Willpower

The targets succumb to a magical sleep. When cast on unsuspecting creatures they enter a deep sleep for duration of 30 minutes (a short rest). It is challenging to wake creatures under this spell unless they are dealt damage. If the target was already trying to get to sleep, it lasts for 8 hours (a long rest).

Creatures fall prone when they fall asleep.

When cast on creatures in combat, the active adrenaline in their body makes the sleep last for only 1 minute (10 rounds). Additionally, every round they get a chance to resist and wake from the sleep at the start of their turn (except for their first turn while asleep). Dealing damage to these creatures will automatically wake them.

This spell's focus cost increases by 1 and difficulty increases by 2 for each additional creature you target.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and can only effect a single creature.

## Speak with Animals

**Specializations:** Animism (Bonus: Trained (r4))  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Target:** Self  
**Duration:** 24 hours (concentration)

You gain the ability to properly communicate with animals. This provides advantage to wild empathy checks, and allows you to receive a responses you can understand. While you are capable of articulating more advanced concepts, the animal is less capable. Most responses received will be either in very simple sentences or as an emotion. You may still require their trust before you receive a truthful response. Attempts to articulate complex concepts beyond the scope of a wild animal will be completely misunderstood.

***Graze:*** Only a single message may be sent back and forth, then the effect is lost.

## Spirit Communion

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Balance, Conjuration, Justice ((Bonus: Adept (r6))), Light, Militarism  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Extended (1 minute)

**Range:** 1m  
**Target:** One dead creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You perform simple rites to honour the spirit of a dead creature nearby. The body does not need to be completely intact, but a majority of its body must be present. If the creature died recently (within the last 7 days) and their spirit is willing, it will manifest from the corpse and can be spoken to. The spirit cannot travel further than 1m from its dead body, but the body can be physically moved to move the spirit. If the body is significantly damaged while the spirit is present, then the spirit will disappear and it can no longer be summoned.

If the creature did not die recently and/or only bones remain, this spell may be cast with an increased focus cost of 1 and spell difficulty of 5 for each of those things that are wrong. If only ashes remain or a severely incomplete corpse, then this spell still cannot be performed.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration and only you can hear the spirit of the creature.

## Suggestion

**Specializations:** Authority, Enchantment, Evocation, Fire, Order (Bonus: Adept (r6))  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 hour (until request met)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You make a simple request of a creature. If that creature can understand what you are saying, and the request does not cause harm to that creature or its allies, it must do as you ask. Even if the creature resists this spell, they will not be aware that the suggestion was magical.

***Critical:*** The request is no longer than two sentences.  
***Success:*** The request is no longer than a sentences.  
***Graze:*** The request is a single action of one or two words.

## Telekinesis

**Specializations:** Air, Arcane, Kiai, Transmutation  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature or object  
**Duration:** Instant or 5 minutes (concentration, range)  
**Resist:** Fortitude

You can manipulate any object or creature as you could manually with your hands, but from a distance. This includes moving objects, opening doors, and even carrying and making attacks with melee weapons from a distance (subject to all normal attack rules). This distance is limited by the range of this spell.

If you attempt anything that would require the use of your strength, such as attack damage, or an athletics check, use the stat associated with the spellcasting skill used to cast this spell instead of your strength (usually intelligence or resolve).

Any objects can only be moved a total distance equal to twice the range of this spell, per turn, unless they are thrown (and released from your telekinesis). Concentrating on this spell allows you to manipulate an object continuously without recasting this spell.

***Graze:*** Concentration cannot be maintained on the object.

## Water Breathing

**Specializations:** Air, Enchantment, Shouki, Transmutation, Water  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 10m  
**Target:** One or more creatures  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Allows the targets to breath underwater the same as they breath air above water, by providing them with magical gills. This does not prevent them from breathing air. This spell's focus cost and difficulty increase by 1 for each additional creature that you target.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and can only effect a single target.

## Water Jet

**Specializations:** Conjuration, Water  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature, object, or point  
**Duration:** Instant  
**Resist:** Fortitude

Soak a target with a stream of water generated from your body, optionally pushing it a distance up to 3m away. This stream of water can be generated from a body of water (up to a distance away based on the range of this spell) instead of your body. Doing so gives the stream twice the range and pushback, but costs 1 addditional focus and with 2 higher difficulty. This spell can also be used to put out fires and stop objects or creatures from burning. When used on grease or oil fires it will not stop any burning.

***Graze:*** The target can only be pushed half the distance (rounded up).
