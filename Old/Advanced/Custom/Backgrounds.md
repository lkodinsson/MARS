# Custom Backgrounds

If you have a character backstory idea that does not correspond to a pre-existing background, you can design one for yourself.

Custom backgrounds are very simple to make. To begin, they require a description of a few sentences that determines the scope of what your character has done in their past, and what limits their knowledge skill. Then, simply pick two of any basic or core advanced skills to give a +1 bonus to.
