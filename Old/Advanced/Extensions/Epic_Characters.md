## Epic Characters

The upper limit of power that characters can achieve is high enough to overcome most but not all difficulty challenge ratings with consistency. In this way, certain challenges can remain significantly difficult yet technically achievable by utilizing circumstance and advantage. However, if you really want to push the upper power limit of characters, you can. This is useful for adventures where you want characters to act more like demigods or superheroes.

Epic characters have their growth accelerated and receive double the experience points. The tables for skill steps, toughness, and primary stats are all extended to accomodate the increase in experience:
