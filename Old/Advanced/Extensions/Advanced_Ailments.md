## Injuries

Endurance and health are numerical abstractions designed to simplify injuries. If this is not enough, more extreme measures can be applied. Injuries are effectively permanent debilitations and are applied to primary stats in the same way. A character can be both injured and debilitated affecting the same primary stat.

Whenever a character is reduced to zero or less health during an encounter, at the end of that encounter they become injured. The type of injury can be determined at random or by choice. Injuries can only be applied to primary stats that are not already injured. If a character already has all their stats affected by injuries and they would get another, then they simply die instead.

Injuries can be recovered by resting for a long period of time ranging 9 to 12 months in-game time. Characters that assist in recovery of this can use the medicine skill against a difficulty of 14 (Hard) reduce this to half the time. If the recovering character has more than one injury then it is made against a difficulty of 19 (Challenging) instead. Only one injury can be recovered at a time.

Special abilities that can remove debilitations can also remove injuries.

## Fatigue

It is normally assumed that characters meet all the requirements to maintain their bodies. Characters that fail to either eat, drink, or sleep, will accumulate fatigue. All sources of fatigue are tracked separately, but apply their effects cumulatively.

Fatigue is an effect that is very similar to sickness and has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. Fatigue applies a penalty to *all* rolls, reduces movement, causes loss of health each day, and causes a reduction in stamina, focus, and endurance recovered during all rests, each equal to half the degree of fatigue (rounded up).

Failure to eat food results in one degree of fatigue from starvation, which is a failure to eat three meals over any period of time (such as one meal missed every day for three days). Fatigue from dehydration is caused by failing to consume one litre of water each day, while fatigue from lack of sleep is caused by failing to take a long rest each day. Dehydration causes two degrees of fatigue, while lack of sleep causes one degree.

### Recovering from Fatigue

When a character accumulating fatigue properly meets the requirements of their body, they will then remove up to two degrees from that source of fatigue. If a character is failing to meet multiple requirements, these degrees of fatigue can only be recovered from the source that they have fulfilled.

For example: when a starving character finally eats a full day's worth of meals, they remove up to two degrees of fatigue from starvation. Continuing to eat a full day's worth of meals will continue to remove accumulated fatigue in this way, but it will never remove any degrees of fatigue caused by dehydration or lack of sleep.

Special abilities that can remove sickness can also remove fatigue, but only up to two degrees at a time and only from a single source of fatigue.
