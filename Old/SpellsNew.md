**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of purpose. They get a +1 bonus to all rolls. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of good fortune, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus. This spell and the curse spell cancel each other out.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell curse does on living creatures.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Curse

**Specializations:** Authority, Darkness, Entropy, Militarism  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it unease and a feeling of a futility. They get a -1 penalty to all rolls. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of misfortune, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus. This spell and the bless spell cancel each other out.

This spell may be used to have the same effect on undead creatures as the spell bless does on living creatures.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Elemental Ward

**Specializations:** Air (Electric), Arcane, Darkness (Void), Discipline, Enchantment, Fire,  Light (Radiant), Militarism, Shouki, Water (Cold)  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** Touch or 6m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Provide a creature with your choice of protection versus one of: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*. For the duration, all attacks of that type deal half damage after any damage reduction.

You may choose an additional type of protection by increasing the focus cost by 1 and the spell's difficulty by 5. This may even be done twice to allow protection versus up to three types.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Entangle

**Specializations:** Authority, Balance, Earth, Entropy, Harmony  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Standard

**Range:** 20m  
**Target:** One point  
**Duration:** 1 minute  
**Resist:** Agility (vs entanglement), Athletics (to break free)  

Plants in a 6m radius grow into spiny vines that begin to entangle all creatures in the radius. Any creature who starts their turn or steps onto or through the entangling area must resist using Agility or become entangled and take damage. Grazing against this effect allows the creature to avoid entanglement but still take damage. This effect occurs every time the creature attempts to move while still in the entangling area. Creatures that do not treat the entangling area as difficult terrain get disadvantage to their resist roll.

Entangled creatures cannot move unless they spend a swift action and make an Athletics check to break free. Failing to break free also causes the vines to deal damage. Grazing against this effect allows the creature to break free but still take damage.

***Critical:*** The vines deal 6 piercing damage.  
***Success:*** The vines deal 4 piercing damage.  
***Graze:*** The vines deal 2 piercing damage, last for half the duration, and with half the radius.

## Guidance

**Specializations:** Altruism, Balance, Evocation, Fire, Harmony, Impulse, Yuuki  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** Touch or 10m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 1 minute (until used)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You lay your hand upon another creature, providing it comfort and a feeling of intention. They get a +1 bonus to the next skill check they perform. You may cast this spell at a range by speaking words of advice, but the spell will cost 1 additional focus.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and only provides the bonus to skills the target is at least trained in.

## Mental Strike

**Specializations:** Air, Arcane, Darkness, Enchantment, Entropy, Impulse, Shouki  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 20m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Resist:** Willpower (graze for half damage)

You barrage the target with a series of vicious words that cut deep into the target's mind dealing arcane damage. If the target does not understand the language you use, they get advantage to resist the spell. This spell deals half damage if it grazes against the target's resistance and does not cause the target to lose concentration.

***Critical:*** Roll willpower plus 4 to deal arcane damage and the target loses concentration.  
***Success:*** Roll willpower to deal arcane damage.  
***Graze:*** Roll willpower minus 4 to deal arcane damage.

**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

Provide a creature with your choice of protection versus one of: *blunt*, *piercing*, or *slashing*. For the duration, all attacks of that type deal half damage after any damage reduction.

You may choose an additional type of protection by increasing the focus cost by 1 and the spell's difficulty by 5. This may even be done twice to allow protection versus all types.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration.

## Sacred Bond

**Specializations:** Altruism, Authority, Balance, Discipline, Harmony  
**Spell Tier:** 1 (Cantrip)

**Action Speed:** Swift

**Range:** 3m  
**Target:** One creature  
**Duration:** 24 hours  
**Resist:** Willpower

You form a sacred bond between yourself and a target, allowing you to cast spells that require touch which target that creature but instead up to a distance of 100m away. This bond is not broken no matter how far away they are, but only lasts for a duration of 24 hours. While this spell does not require concentration, you may only have a sacred bond with one target at a time.

***Critical:*** Lasts indefinitely, and up to twice the distance.  
***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration, and half the distance.

## Spirit Communion

**Specializations:** Augury, Authority, Balance, Conjuration, Light, Militarism  
**Spell Tier:** 2 (Lesser)

**Action Speed:** Extended (1 minute)

**Range:** 1m  
**Target:** One dead creature  
**Duration:** 5 minutes (concentration)  
**Resist:** Willpower

You perform simple rites to honour the spirit of a dead creature nearby. The body does not need to be completely intact, but a majority of its body must be present. If the creature died recently (within the last 7 days) and their spirit is willing, it will manifest from the corpse and can be spoken to. The spirit cannot travel further than 1m from its dead body, but the body can be physically moved to move the spirit. If the body is significantly damaged while the spirit is present, then the spirit will disappear and it can no longer be summoned.

If the creature did not die recently and/or only bones remain, this spell may be cast with an increased focus cost of 1 and spell difficulty of 5 for each of those things that are wrong. If only ashes remain or a severely incomplete corpse, then this spell still cannot be performed.

***Graze:*** Lasts for half the duration and only you can hear the spirit of the creature.
