# Improvised Crafting

When under time pressure or with less than ideal means, certain tools and equipment can be improvised by crafting. This will involve a normal skill check to craft a single-use item for the purposes of overcoming a challenge. Items crafted in this way are not typically permanent items, but are more often alterations to the environment for the purposes of roleplaying.

For more permanent item crafting, it will require the use of *downtime crafting*.

# Downtime Crafting

Before any item can be crafted there are several requirements: *access to materials*, *access to tools*, *access to a workspace*, and *associated skills*. Once these conditions are met, you may craft an item.

Access to materials, tools, and workspace, are relatively straightforward. Do you have crafting materials or access to a marketplace? Do you have a relevant toolkit or workshop? Finally, do you possess any familiarity with the item you intend to craft, either in your trait, background, archetype, or skills?

To craft an item, you must know the cost of that item. This will determine how difficult it is to craft, and how long it will take. This process may require significant amounts of time and is typically only performed by characters who have plenty of time to spend in between narrative scenarios.

##### Table: Item Crafting Cost, Diffilculty, & Time
| Item Cost | Difficulty | Time |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0.1 | 4 | 15 minutes |

## Crafting Check

Once an item has been chosen, you may begin to craft an item.

> ##### Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 60  
> **Difficulty:** 12  
> **Time:** 4 days

Once the time has been spent, the character rolls a crafting check which determines the actual amount of currency spent to craft that item.

***Critical:*** Pay 80% of the cost.  
***Success:*** Pay 90% of the cost.  
***Graze:*** Pay 100% of the cost.  
***Failure:*** Pay 10% of the cost, and the item is not created.

Round up on any costs paid.

> ##### Crafting Example with Check
> **Cost:** 60  
> **Difficulty:** 12  
> **Time:** 4 days
>___
> **Craft Check:** Success  
> **Cost Paid:** 54 (90% of 60)

An item may only be crafted if enough currency is prepared in advance to pay for the maximum expected cost of that item. Currency spent in this way represents materials purchased to craft the item.

## Free Materials

Under special circumstances, your Game Master may provide you with materials suited for the creation of certain items. In this case, those materials will cover an amount of an item's cost. This can be represented as a flat amount, or as a percentage.

> ##### Crafting Example with Free Materials
> **Cost:** 60  
> **Difficulty:** 12  
> **Time:** 4 days
>___
> **Free Materials:** 30 (50%)  
> **Effective Cost:** 30

This changes the effective cost of that item, which is what will actually be spent when the item is crafted. This does not change the actual cost of the item, which determines its difficulty and crafting time.

For example: If a craft check was made resulting in a critical success on the above item, it would be 80% of the effective cost of 30. The cost paid would then be 24.

# Alternate Methods

There are several additional methods that modify how items can be crafted. Most of these methods can even be used together.

## Upgrading

Rather than making an item from scratch, an item can be upgraded into a similar item with alternate qualities. Different qualities or combinations of qualities, will provide different multipliers to the total cost as determined by the item and quality. In this case, determine the difficulty by the total cost of the item, and the time by the difference.

> ##### Upgrade Example
> **Base Item Cost:** 50  
> **Quality Multiplier:** 4
>___
> **Total Cost:** 200 = 50×4  
> **Difficulty:** 15  
>___
> **Upgrade Cost:** 150 = 200-50  
> **Time:** 9 days

## Bulk Crafting

Multiple identical items can be made as a part of a single craft check by combining their costs together. The time to craft the item is determined by the combined cost of that item, but the difficulty remains the same.

> ##### Bulk Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 2  
> **Difficulty:** 7  
> **Time:** 2 hours 
>___
> **Quantity:** 10  
> **Cost:** 20 (2×10)  
> **Time:** 3 days (from 2 hours)

## Long-Term Crafting

If you find yourself with exceptionally long periods of time available to craft items, the time spent to craft them can be extended to reduce the crafting difficulty. In effect, this can make greater degrees of success easier to reach, resulting in a higher likelihood of paying a reduced cost.

The degree that crafting can be slowed down depends on the advancement of your craft skill.

##### Table: Long-Term Crafting Steps
| Craft<br/>Skill Step | Maximum<br/>Adjustments | 
|:-:|:-:|
| r4 | 1 |
| r8 | 2 |
| r12 | 3 |
| r16 | 4 |
| r20 | 5 |

For each adjustment, treat the difficulty as 1 lower, and the time as if the difficulty was 1 higher.

> ##### Long-Term Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 20  
> **Difficulty:** 11  
> **Time:** 3 days
>___
> **Long-Term Adjustments:** 2  
> **Difficulty Adjusted:** 9 (from 11)  
> **Time Adjusted:** 5 days (from 3 days)

This may be combined with bulk crafting:

> ##### Bulk Long-Term Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 2  
> **Difficulty:** 7  
> **Time:** 2 hours 
>___
> **Quantity:** 10  
> **Cost:** 20 (2×10)  
> **Time:** 3 days (from 2 hours)
>___
> **Long-Term Adjustments:** 2  
> **Difficulty Adjusted:** 5 (from 7)  
> **Time Adjusted:** 5 days (from 3 days)

## Group Crafting

Multiple characters can work together to craft an item, speeding up the process and reducing the risk of failure.

For each additional participant in a craft, the time is reduced as if the difficulty was 1 lower.

When it comes time to roll a craft check, each participant will roll, but only the best result will be kept. Participants may choose to split the costs as they see fit.

> ##### Group Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 14  
> **Time:** 7 days
>___
> **Participants:** 4 (3 additional)  
> **Time Adjusted:** 3 days (from 7)

This may be combined with long-term crafting:

> ##### Group Long-Term Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 100  
> **Difficulty:** 14  
> **Time:** 7 days
>___
> **Long-Term Adjustments:** 2  
> **Participants:** 4 (3 additional)  
> **Difficulty Adjusted:** 12 (from 14)  
> **Time Adjusted:** 5 days (from 7)

## Incomplete Crafting

Under circumstances where only part of the required time to craft an item is met, a craft is considered incomplete. At the end of the time that was spent, a craft check is made as normal. The percentage of the item crafted and the cost paid are both proportional to the time spent versus the total time required.

> ##### Incomplete Crafting Example
> **Cost:** 200  
> **Difficulty:** 15  
> **Time:** 9 days
>___
> **Time Spent:** 4 days  
> **Percentage Crafted:** 44% (4/9)  
> **Percentage Remaining:** 56%  
> **Craft Check:** Success  
> **Cost Paid:** 79.2 (90% of 44% of 200)

At a later date, the craft may be resumed where the remaining percentage of the item determines the cost and time to craft, but at a difficulty determined by the original cost.

> ##### Incomplete Crafting Example Resumed
> **Cost:** 200  
> **Difficulty:** 15  
> **Time:** 9 days  
>___
> **Percentage Crafted:** 44%  
> **Percentage Remaining:** 56%  
> **Cost Remaining:** 112 (56% of 200)  
> **Time Adjusted:** 7 days (from 9 days)

The remaining time to craft is determined by treating the cost of the remaining percentage as if it was the whole cost to craft. Breaking up crafting into multiple steps this way can result in a craft that takes longer overall but can be done in short bursts.
