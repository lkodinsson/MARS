## Casting Spells

There are several different ways to cast spells, as represented by the spellcasting skills: [*animism*](/Fantasy/Skills.md#animism-res), [*faith*](/Fantasy/Skills.md#faith-res), [*ki*](/Fantasy/Skills.md#ki), [*sorcery*](/Fantasy/Skills.md#sorcery-res), and [*wizardry*](/Fantasy/Skills.md#wizardry-int). Regardless of the skill used, they all effectively function the same way.

To cast a spell you must perform the following steps:

1. Wait for the complete action time required to cast that spell.
2. Roll your spellcasting skill and associated stat versus the spell's difficulty.
3. Regardless of success, spend focus equal to that spell's cost.
4. The targets (if any) may roll to resist the effects of that spell (if allowed).
5. Perform the effects of that spell based on your degree of success versus the target's resist.

Most spells have varying degrees of effect based on how well you roll to cast them the same as normal skill checks: *failure*, *graze*, *success*, and *critical success*. Regardless of your degree of success, you may choose to downgrade the success of your spell (your roll is the same, and you choose a lower success category). Failure to cast a spell not only causes the spell to not perform its intended effect, but also causes additional unintended effects. The exact nature of these effects is to be determined by the Game Master based on the spell attempted. The lowest degree of success you can choose to perform is a graze (you cannot downgrade your degree of success to a failure). <!--If a spell does not specify reduced effects as a graze, then grazes are considered failures instead.-->

If the targets of your spells choose to resist, they roll the appropriate stat or skill as specified by that spell. They are rolling an opposed check against the roll you already made to cast that spell. If the targets of that spell are granted future opportunities to resist that spell, they will continue to roll resist checks against the same value. Unless a spell states otherwise, if a spell grazes against a resist roll, all effects are negated. Spells that deal damage typically deal half damage when grazing against a target's resistance.

Additional spells cast during the same turn get a -3 penalty to cast for each spell you cast before it in the same turn. This is known as the *multiple spell penalty*. Spells cast as a reaction are exempt from this penalty (such as by a readied action).

## Learning Spells

Even though there are several spellcasting skills, they do share some spells. Spells will have a list of specializations that are required to learn them. Most spells have several specializations in which they are usable. When you become trained in one of the spellcasting skills, you also will pick a specialization of that skill. Unless otherwise stated, whenever you advance in a spellcasting skill, you will learn a new spell to cast with that skill. Similarly, when your character starts with a spellcasting skill, they start with spells known in the same way based on your advancement.

Spells are broken down into tiers which determine both their difficulty to cast, and at what skill rank they are allowed to be learned. All spells of the same tier have the same base focus cost and spellcasting difficulty. Although this is the primary determining factor, some spells have additional rules allowing you to cast them differently which may or may not modify these values. These modifications only change how the spell is cast, and not what tier they belong to.

##### Table: Spell Tiers
| Tier | Tier Name | Focus Cost | Spellcasting Difficulty |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | Cantrip | 1 | 10 (Moderate) |
| 2 | Lesser | 2 | 15 (Hard) |
| 3 | Greater | 3 | 20 (Challenging) |
| 4 | Heroic | 4 | 25 (Ambitious) |

The highest tier spell you can learn is determined by the dice step you are advancing to. You may still choose to learn spells of a lower tier when you advance.

##### Table: Spell Learning Tier Limit

| r10 | Proficient | 2 (Lesser) |
| r12 | Exceptional | 2 (Lesser) |
| r14 | Disciplined | 3 (Greater) |
| r16 | Accomplished | 3 (Greater) |
| r18 | Expert | 3 (Greater) |
| r20 | Master | 4 (Heroic) |

### Specialization Restrictions

Certain spells have their flexibility limited by the specialization that they are learned from. This restriction is listed next to the name for that specialization in the entry for that spell.

## Duration Conditions

Some spells will have a listed duration with *concentration* or some other condition listed. This means that the spell will last either until the duration is met, or the condition is fulfilled. Spells requiring concentration last as long as you decide to maintain concentration on that spell, until the duration is exceeded, or you become stunned or unconscious. If any other condition is listed, then the spell ends as soon as that condition is met or broken. If a concentration spell ends while you are still maintaining concentration, you may spend the focus cost of that spell to renew its duration.
