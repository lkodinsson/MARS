#### Blind

Blinded characters suffer a disadvantage to all rolls that require that character to attack, interact with, brandish, or use special abilities at, a specified target. This does not count for interacting with or brandishing their own personal items. In addition to this, all terrain is difficult to move across.

---

#### Burning

Burning objects are dangerous and likely to cause nearby objects to continue to burn if not contained or extinguished. Burning characters suffer damage over time.

When applied to a character, burning is an effect that has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. If a burning character has burning applied to them, add the burning values together. At the beginning of a burning character's turn, they take fire damage equal to r4 plus r2 for every degree of burning beyond the first, then the burning effect decreases by 1, until it goes away entirely. Burning 1 would be r4 damage, while burning 3 would be r8 damage. Damage from burning bypasses all damage reduction. Dousing a target in water will completely remove the burning.

#### Debilitation

A debilitation is an effect that applies to one of your stats. Debilitated stats are rolled with disadvantage. Multiple debilitations to the same stat do not stack.

---

#### Dying

When a character is given the dying effect they are also become unconscious. At the start of each turn that a character is dying, they must make a fortitude check versus a difficulty equal to their negative health. If that character succeeds three times, they lose the dying condition, but remain unconscious. If they fail three times, they die. Criticals count as two successes, and grazes count as neither a success or failure. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive. Stabilized characters remain at negative health. At the end of every round that a character is dying they lose one more health.

---

#### Encumbered

Encumbered characters are carrying too much. They get a disadvantage to both strength and dexterity, and have halved speed.

---

#### Enhancement

An enhancement is an effect that applies to one of your stats. Enhanced stats are rolled with advantage. Multiple enhancements to the same stat do not stack.

---

#### Overencumbered

Overencumbered characters suffer the same effects as encumbered characters, but instead of moving at half speed, they cannot move at all.

---

#### Prone

Prone characters are either kneeling or laying down on the ground. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. You must spend a swift action to stand up from being prone.

---

#### Sickness

Sickness is an effect that has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. This number is a penalty that you take to *all* of your rolls. Additionally, every day that passes while you are sick you lose health (after recovering health from resting, if applicable) equal to half this sickness value (rounded up). Stamina, focus, and endurance recovered during rests are also reduced by half this value (rounded up) to a minimum of one.

For example: If you have a sickness of 3 and you take a long rest, you will recover 1 health, then lose 2. You will also recover 2 less stamina, focus, and endurance during that rest.

Multiple sickness effects do not add their degree of effect together, instead only apply a penalty based on the strongest sickness effect. Multiple sources of sickness are still tracked separately.

If a sickness effect does not specify a duration, that duration is assumed to be 1 week. After reaching this duration the sickened character will roll a fortitude check to resist the sickness. If successful, the degree of effect is reduced by 1. If no difficulty is specified, it is assumed to be 10 (moderate).

---

#### Stunned

At the beginning of a stunned character's turn, they lose the stunned effect and 1 action point. Until then, stunned characters cannot perform reactions.

A character can become stunned multiple times, causing them to lose more action points at the beginning of their turn. Regardless of how many times a character is stunned, they will entirely lose the stun effect when their turn begins.

For example: A character manages to become stunned four times before their next turn. At the beginning of their turn they will lose 4 action points (their whole turn), and no longer be stunned. They may still perform an action with a speed of 0.

If a character is in the middle of an action or readying an action and they become stunned, then that action becomes interrupted and will not be performed.

---

#### Unconscious

Unconscious characters can perform no actions. Loud noises or other disrupting behaviour may awaken an unconscious individual. When a character becomes unconscious they also become prone.
