#### Attack

**Action Type:** One Action

Make an attack on a target with one of your wielded weapons or with your bare hands. When making an attack, first roll your appropriate combat skill against your target's deflection. A result of a graze, success, or critical, are all considered a hit, and a failure is considered a miss.

On a hit, you then roll your weapon's damage. Damage from successful hits are reduced by the target's damage reduction. Damage from grazing hits are reduced by 5 in addition to the target's damage reduction. The minimum amount of damage that is dealt by a hit is 1 damage. Critical hits both ignore damage reduction and deal bonus damage as specified by the weapon used.

Additional attacks made during the same turn get a -5 penalty to hit for each attack made before it in the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of attack actions (such as maneuvers) except for reactions (such as by a readied action). This is known as the *multiple attack penalty*.

Attacks made against enemies who cannot see you, or who are surrounded on two opposite sides, are made with advantage. These are known as *sneak attacks* and *flanking attacks* respectively. You do not need to be contributing to a flank to make a flanking attack (such as making a ranged attack against a flanked target). If you make an attack that is both a sneak attack and a flanking attack it will provide you double advantage on that attack roll.

<!--
On a hit, you then roll your weapon's damage. Both grazing hits and successful hits are reduced by the target's damage reduction. Damage from grazing hits are then further reduced by half. The minimum amount of damage that is dealt by a hit is 1 damage. Critical hits both ignore damage reduction and deal bonus damage as specified by the weapon used.

#### Block

**Action Type:** Free Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

If you have been hit by an attack in front of you, you may use your shield to absorb the damage. If you do, the shield is considered to be hit instead of you. Any damage taken is then dealt to your shield's durability which is reduced by the block value of that shield. Similar to normal attacks, damage from grazing hits are reduced by 5 in addition to the shield's block value. Critical hits do not deal bonus damage to the shield, but instead simply ignore the block value. Any on hit effects from that hit are given to your shield instead of you if possible, otherwise they cause no effect.

If the shield would be dealt damage in excess of the shield's durability, the remaining damage is dealt directly to you as if it was damage from a successful hit, which is then reduced by your armour's damage reduction as normal (to a minimum of 1). Shields with no durability are considered broken and cannot be used to block (or parry) until they are repaired.

---

#### Brandish

**Action Type:** Free Action

Choose which of your items you are wielding in your hands. This can be items from your inventory, or items found in your immediate area.

---

#### Drop Prone

**Action Type:** Free Action

You become prone. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. While prone your movement speed is halved. 

<!-- Possible alternate text: "Attacks made at a range of 3m or greater against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but attacks made within 1m are made with advantage." -->

---

#### Evade

**Action Time:** Reaction or Free Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

As a free reaction you may roll your evasion to defend against an attack instead of using your deflection. If the incoming attack grazes against your evasion roll, then the incoming attack is considered a failure instead of a graze. After you evade, you may drop prone. Instead of dropping prone you may move up to 1m, but the evade must be done as a normal reaction (instead of a free reaction).

---

#### Interact

**Action Type:** Variable

This action covers most basic tasks, like opening doors, activating wielded items, or using objects in the immediate area. Unless an object specifies, or a task requires an extended amount of time to perform, this action is considered to be one action.

---

#### Move

**Action Type:** One Action

Move a distance up to your speed. If you move only 1m, this is considered a free action. Additionally, this action costs 1 stamina if it is not the first time you have used it during your turn.

If the terrain you are moving over is rough or difficult to navigate, then you can only move half as far over that terrain. If your speed is 1m or less, you can still move at least 1m over difficult terrain for each move action. Movement limited in this way to only 1m cannot be performed as a free action (as per the above rule). This includes moving only 1m if your movement speed is reduced to 2m or less.

---

#### Parry

**Action Type:** Free Reaction  
**Stamina Cost:** 1

Use a wielded item with the parry feature to defend against an attack, adding its parry value to your deflection. If the incoming attack grazes against your deflection roll, then the incoming attack is considered a failure instead of a graze.

---

#### Ready an Action

**Action Type:** Two Actions

Declare any action type of two actions or less to instead use as a reaction given a specified trigger of your choice. For example: while standing at the end of a hallway, you can ready an attack action against any targets that come into view (such as from a room attached to that hallway). Readied actions are performed immediately, even if that means they might happen in the middle of, or before, another action. This can include spells, maneuvers, or any other special abilities or actions.

This action may only be taken as your last action during your turn.

<!-- Could instead be variable action type equivalent to the action readied... but then it's an exploit to always get one attack without the multiple attack penalty... I mean it kind of already is, but at least it costs an extra action. -->

---

#### Rise from Prone

**Action Type:** One Action

You cancel the effects of prone. Ranged and melee attacks against you are made as normal, and your movement speed is restored.

---

#### Seek Cover

**Action Type:** One Action

If you are next to a barricade, the edge of a wall, or some similar structure, you can seek cover behind that object. While being provided cover, you are considered to be partially concealed from ranged enemies until your next turn, giving disadvantage to ranged actions made against your deflection and evasion.

You may instead take this action as a free action if you have moved more than once during your turn. If you do, you do not need to hide behind an obstacle to get the benefits; it is as though you are using your speed and movement to avoid being targeted from a distance.

---

#### Use a Skill

**Action Type:** Variable

Skills can be performed as normal during any type of encounter. The exact duration that a skill takes to perform is the same as it would be during any complex challenge. Some skills may take more than a few minutes to complete. This means that most characters who attempt to use complex skills during an encounter may find themselves unable to perform other actions until the action is completed (unless they abandon their attempt).
