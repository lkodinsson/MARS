# Creation and Advancement

## Creating a Character

The process of creating a character is a series of small steps. A character is made up of a few aspects: *ancestry*, *background*, *archetype*, and *trait*. As a reminder, whenever you assign any stat or skill a roll value, it does not mean to roll those dice and assign it the resulting value. It means that you assign it the roll value itself. This represents what you roll when you use that stat or skill.

### Ancestry

It is not guaranteed that a genre has a multitude of ancestry options, but Humans are usually an available option. The ancestry you pick will provide bonuses to your primary stats, a ancestry ability, and determine your size and movement speed.

### Background

Backgrounds are the profession or history of your character before they left that life behind them to become an adventurer or hero (or whatever the genre you are playing calls them). The background you choose will provide bonuses to some of your skills.

### Archetype

Archetypes get you on the path to building a character with a strong theme, but they do not limit any of your character advancement options. Essentially they are a title that provides you with some benefits, much like backgrounds. They determine what skills and abilities you start with.

Click [here](/Core/Characters/Archetypes.md) for the list of archetypes.

### Trait

Traits are unique abilities that only you possess. This part of character creation is entirely up to you (and your Game Master). Generally traits are special things you can do or have. They provide opportunities to roleplay in a unique way, or help make your character stand out from others with a similar background or archetype. They can be mundane or magical in nature, and are something you can describe in a couple sentences. Traits should provide some degree of actual mechanical benefit, but the exact benefit is to be determined by the context of your adventure and what your Game Master determines is fair.

The trait you decide upon can be something very similar to an existing talent or spell, but the obvious drawback is that you don't get some other type of unique ability.

### Starting Stats

After choosing your ancestry, background, archetype, and trait, you will need to decide what your starting primary stats are. Assign one of them to be *above average* (r12), one of them to be *below average* (r8), and the rest as *average* (r10).

### Motivation

One of the most important defining features of a character is their motivation. It can be described in a few sentences or less. Ultimately it will be a source of both conflict and cooperation, as characters will need to make decisions that fulfill their motivations. Characters that fulfill their motivations during a game session provide an experience bonus to all characters at the end of a game session.

Example: To protect the weak from those who abuse their power.

Some motivations may represent more circumstantial character developmental ordeals. These types of motivations when completed are usually then replaced with another motivation, assuming that it doesn't end that character's heroic journey. Because these types of motivations are more difficult to complete, making progress towards completing that motivation is considered enough to provide the experience bonus.

Example: To find a lost family member; or to avenge a death.

## Equipment

Characters start with some degree of currency or equipment. Most items that a character can acquire and use are normal worldly items. The only restriction is if it meets the genre you are playing in. For example: machine guns or flashlights are not a likely device to have in a medieval genre, but a torch or a sword is.

Although you can generally have any item imaginable, some items have predetermined statistics like weapons and armour.

### Currency

There are various types of currencies that represent the money your character needs to spend on items and goods. All of the values of items are represented by a cost in generic unit of money. Different currencies have a value relative to the generic unit of money (which depend on the genre) including a specified baseline currency. In one genre the cost of an item may be measured in dollars ($) and in another the cost could measured in silver pieces (sp). Sometimes there may be additional currencies usable at the same time like nuyen (¥) or gold pieces (gp).

All characters start with 50 units of money which they can spend on starting equipment.

### Weapons

Weapons are the means to inflict attacks upon opponents using combat skills. Weapons exist in multiple categories named after the combat skill required to use them. There is also a category of basic weapons, which can be used by anyone trained in any of the combat skills. Weapons will have both a listed damage roll value, and a damage type. Some creatures and armours may be weaker to certain damage types. Although unarmed attacks are not actually made with weapons, they are listed under the unarmed weapon category.

Click [here](/Core/Items/Equipment.md#weapons) for the rules for weapons and weapon features.

### Armour

Although a character can wear any amount of gear, such as clothes, gloves, boots, headgear, cloaks, accessories, and so on, only some of these items are considered *armour*. Armour exists in a few specific *armour slots* when worn: *body*, *head*, *arms*, *hands*, *shield*, *legs*, and *feet*. Armour items will have some minor features, but usually they also have an armour rating and a damage reduction. The values from all of your slots are added together to provide a total armour rating and damage reduction.

Some armours will have a strength value listed. This value is the recommended strength required to wear that armour. If your maximum strength does not meet the requirement, then you get a penalty equal to half of the difference (rounded up) known as the *armour penalty*. Only the highest armour penalty (from a single item) that you wear takes effect. Your armour penalty is applied to all dexterity skill checks (including attack rolls and evasion) and speed.

For example: if you have a maximum strength of 11, and you are wearing a piece of armour with a strength requirement of 16, you will have a -3 armour penalty.

Click [here](/Core/Items/Equipment.md#armour) for the rules for armour and armour features.

### Equipment Properties

While individual listings for equipment have specific features, they can also have certain details modified which allows for different versions of the same type of item to be represented. This can be represented as a change to that item's quality or weight, or as a material change.

In genres with magic equipment can also have magical properties with wide ranging effects. These can change how the item functions entirely or empower the user of the item.

### Carrying Capacity

Many items will have a listed weight. Although it is optional to keep track of the weight of items, sometimes it might be necessary if a character is carrying an exceptional amount of them, especially if they are weak, or the items are very heavy. In this case you would need to determine the your carrying capacity. This is determined by your size, strength, and athletics. Although items do not have a listed size or bulk, use reason to determine how many large items a character can carry.

##### Table: Carrying Capacity
| Modifier | Formula |
|:-|:-|
| Light Capacity (kg) | (Max STR + Max Athletics) × 3 |
| Heavy Capacity (kg) | (Max STR + Max Athletics) × 5 |
| Tiny | Capacity × ¼ |
| Very Small | Capacity × ½ |
| Small | Capacity × ¾ |
| Medium | Capacity × 1 |
| Large | Capacity × 1½ |
| Very Large | Capacity × 2 |
| Huge | Capacity × 3 |

If a character exceeds their light capacity they become encumbered (getting a disadvantage to strength and dexterity, and have their speed halved). If they exceed their heavy capacity then they become overencumbered (and cannot move).

Casual carrying of items over extended periods of time is different than momentary displays of physical ability. Typically you can expect that someone can lift items near their heavy capacity over a very short distance, and push or drag something weighing four times that amount over a moderate distance (up to ten times that amount if assisted by wheels).

## Advancing a Character

As you play the game your character will acquire experience points. These points can then be spent to improve your character's stats and skills, and to acquire new talents. Total experience points gained and total experience points spent are tracked separately.

The rate at which characters gain experience is determined by what happens during a gaming session. As a baseline: each character receives 2 experience points at the end of every game session. For each player that met their character's motivations during that session, all players receive an additional 1 experience point. This bonus stacks for each player that met their motivations. If a major goal of the adventure is met then each player receives an additional 4 experience points. Additionally, the Game Master may award bonus experience for any other reason, either to all characters, or to individual characters.

The spending of experience points to improve a character is done in between each game session. Players may only advance individual stats, skills, or talents, once each, at each opportunity.

Some Game Masters may require certain roleplaying events to occur for the advancement of certain abilities to be permitted.

### Improving Skills

When you first acquire a new skill it costs 4 experience points. For each skill step beyond that, it will cost an amount of experience equal to half of the roll value of the skill step you are advancing to.

For example: if you are improving a skill from a roll value of r8 to a roll value of r10, it will cost 5 experience points.

##### Table: Skill Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 4 | 4 | r4 | Trained |
| 3 | 7 | r6 | Adept |
| 4 | 11 | r8 | Practiced |
| 5 | 16 | r10 | Proficient |
| 6 | 22 | r12 | Exceptional |
| 7 | 29 | r14 | Disciplined |
| 8 | 37 | r16 | Accomplished |
| 9 | 46 | r18 | Expert |
| 10 | 56 | r20 | Master |

Languages cost half as much as other skills (rounded up):

##### Table: Language Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| 2 | 2 | r4 | Trained |
| 2 | 4 | r6 | Adept |
| 2 | 6 | r8 | Practiced |
| 3 | 9 | r10 | Proficient |
| 3 | 12 | r12 | Exceptional |
| 4 | 16 | r14 | Disciplined |
| 4 | 20 | r16 | Accomplished |
| 5 | 25 | r18 | Expert |
| 5 | 30 | r20 | Master (Fluent) |

#### Skill Limits

Skills have a maximum step that they can be advanced to, which is equal to that of their associated stat.

For example: if you have a *resolve* of r12, then the maximum that your *charisma* skill can be advanced to is also r12.

Skills can be advanced even further if that skill or its primary stat have any additive bonuses. Subtractive penalties do not reduce the maximum that a skill can be advanced.

For example: if you have a *strength* of r10+2, and a +1 bonus to *athletics* then the maximum that your *athletics* skill can be advanced to is r16, which is 3 steps past the roll value of r10 from *strength*.

This limitation does not apply to the advancement of language skills.

### Improving Primary Stats

Improving primary stats functions very similarly to improving skills. The primary difference is that the cost is not equal to half the roll value, but is instead exactly equal to the roll value.

For example: if you are improving a primary stat from a roll value of r12 to a roll value of r14 it would cost 14 experience points.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps & Cost
| Step Cost | Total Cost | Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
| - | - | r8 | Below Average |
| 10 | 10 | r10 | Average |
| 12 | 22 | r12 | Above Average |
| 14 | 36 | r14 | Great |
| 16 | 52 | r16 | Superb |
| 18 | 70 | r18 | Powerful |
| 20 | 90 | r20 | Epic |

#### Experience Checkpoints

There is also a second way that primary stats are improved: as your total experience gained reaches certain checkpoints you get additional bonuses to your stats for free. For every 50 total experience points gained, you will choose one of your primary stats and apply an additional +1 bonus to it. You may only choose a single primary stat twice to receive this bonus.

### Acquiring Talents

While stats and skills typically represent incremental numerical improvements to characters, talents can be acquired to provide more range of ability.

Talents that provide minor abilities cost 4 experience, while those that provide more major abilities cost 8 experience. Some talents can be acquired more than once, such as the [toughness](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#toughness) and [extra maneuver](/Core/Characters/Talents.md#extra-maneuver) talents. These talents may have steps, similar to stats and skills. Each time they are acquired, they will cost 1 more experience for each time you have already acquired that talent.

For example: The first time you acquire the toughness talent it will cost 4 experience, but the second and third times will each cost 5 and 6.

Although some talents are associated with certain archetypes, there are no restrictions stopping any character from acquiring another archetype's starting talent so long as all other requirements are met.
