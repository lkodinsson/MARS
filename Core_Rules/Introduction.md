# Introduction

## The Basics

**MARS** features many similarities to other role-playing game systems. You will control a character that is defined by several abstract features. These features are called *stats*, *skills*, *talents*, and *traits*. Stats and skills are represented by dice or numbers, while talents and traits represent special abilities or actions that a character can perform. As players progress they will be awarded experience points that they can spend to improve the stats and skills of their character, or to acquire new talents.

As a player you will interact inside a world controlled by a Game Master who determines certain properties about the world, such as the genre and setting. The genre of a world determines a lot of its core features like what types of abilities characters can use, what types of characters you will expect to play as and interact with, and what type of technology is present in that world.

## Roll Value

Most roleplaying games typically use standard [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) to describe what dice to roll. MARS uses a modified version of dice notation called *roll value*, which is used to represent many of the game's numeric values. It is used as a shorthand for one or more dice that you will roll when you need to perform any game action using whatever stat, skill, talent, or ability, that has that roll value. Roll values will typically have one or two numbers like so: *r14+1*. The first number following the *r* represents the roll value--and therefore what dice to roll--and the second value represents a numerical modifier as a plus or minus.

##### Table: Roll Values
| Roll Value | Dice to Roll | Number of Dice |
|:-:|:-|:-:|
| r4 | 1d4 | 1 |
| r6 | 1d6 | 1 |
| r8 | 1d8 | 1 |
| r10 | 1d10 | 1 |
| r12 | 1d12 | 1 |
| r14 | 1d10+1d4 | 2 |
| r16 | 1d10+1d6 | 2 |
| r18 | 1d10+1d8 | 2 |
| r20 | 2d10 | 2 |
| r22 | 1d12+1d10 | 2 |
| r24 | 2d10+1d4 | 3 |
| r26 | 2d10+1d6 | 3 |
| r28 | 2d10+1d8 | 3 |
| r30 | 3d10 | 3 |

Basically, you count the number of tens in the roll value, then roll that many ten-sided-dice. Any remainder left over is rolled as a die of that size. For example: A roll value of 14 would be a ten-sided-die and a four-sided-die, while a roll value of r20 would be two ten-sided-dice. There is only one exception to this is: if you get a remainder of 2 then you upgrade one of those ten-sided-dice to a twelve-sided-die instead of rolling an additional die. For example: A roll value of 22 would be a ten-sided-die and a twelve-sided-die.

Roll values can also be estimated using what is called a *passive value*, which is equal to half of the roll value, plus or minus the modifiers. This value is always slightly below your average expected roll, making it a useful tool for estimating what you can expect to roll above. For example: A roll value of 22 would have a passive value of 11. If it was r22+2, then it would have a passive value of 13.

Whenever you add multiple roll values together, they merge into a combined roll value. For example: *r14* plus *r8* equals *r22*.

### Stats

Stats represent the innate capabilities of a character. There are two types of stats: *primary stats* and *secondary stats*. Primary stats are represented by a roll value, and represent how well a character can perform universal tasks. Secondary stats are represented by either a roll value or flat numbers and are more specific properties of a character. While primary stats are something a character simply has, secondary stats are derived from other sources (such as primary stats).

### Skills

Skills represent what your character is practiced in. Like primary stats, skills are represented by a roll value. The two types of skills are *basic skills* and *complex skills*. Basic skills are tasks that anyone can perform, while complex skills can only be performed by characters that are at least trained in that skill. Some of the complex skills that a character can learn depend on the genre you are playing in. While someone who can cast spells might be more typical of a fantasy genre, it would not be as common in a modern genre.

### Talents

Talents are powerful abilities that characters can learn. They usually provide you the ability to perform unique actions that are not simple enough to be performed by skills, or are modifiers to how a character performs their normal abilities. Most talents that can be acquired are dependant on the type of genre you are playing (similar to complex skills).

### Traits

Traits are unique abilities that usually only belong to a single character. They are often an ability that a character can perform, or something they have that affects their life. They are opportunities to roleplay in a way that uniquely fits your character and help them differentiate from other characters that would otherwise be very similar to them.

## Playing the Game

Typically game sessions go as follows: the Game Master describes the scene, the players describe their actions, the Game Master describes the results of those actions, and then the game progresses to the next scene. Through the act of description and exposition, your characters and the world they inhabit become alive.

It is important to focus more on describing what it is your character does, rather than declaring the exact game action your character takes. It is more up to the Game Master to decide what actual game actions you perform, or what skill is required to overcome a challenge. This provides more freedom to narrate your character's intentions, rather than strictly adhering to gamified actions like a traditional board game.

While describing what your character does, try not to detail the results of your character's actions, only the actions themselves. Dice may be rolled to determine the outcome of that action if the outcome is uncertain or failure carries potential consequence. The Game Master is otherwise responsible for deciding the results of your actions.

If at any point during the game you are required to perform math that results in a decimal, that number is always rounded down unless otherwise specified.

## Genres

There are many different worlds and environments that can be played in, worlds featuring one or more of: elves, wizards, dragons, robots, detectives, dinosaurs, cowboys, vikings, samurai, vampires, werewolves, aliens, racecars, superheroes, hackers, secret agents, and endless more.

Content presented in **MARS** is categorized into *genres* which present these many different ideas into coherent groups. These genres are: *prehistoric*, *ancient*, *medieval*, *renaissance*, *industrial*, *post-industrial*, *space*, *historical*, *fantasy*, *steampunk*, *cyberpunk*, and *sci-fantasy*. These genres are often combined and some popular combinations include: *medieval fantasy*, *post-industrial cyberpunk*, *space sci-fantasy*, and *prehistoric steampunk*.
