# Encounters and Abilities

## Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* If two or more characters or creatures intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger, and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is limited time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All characters roll their initiative.
2. If it is combat, determine which characters are aware of their opponents. If these characters are aware of their opponents, but not the other way around, they can act during a surprise round.
3. Characters who are not surprised take turns in initiative order for their team during the surprise round.
4. After the surprise round (if any), all characters take turns in initiative order for their team during regular rounds. This repeats until the encounter ends.

#### Initiative

When it comes time to begin an encounter each player will roll their *initiative*, which is their *dexterity* plus their *resolve*. The team with the highest individual iniative roll goes first. On a tie, the Game Master decides who goes first (usually favouring the player team).

If there are multiple teams in conflict (such as during a combat encounter), each team present will take turns, one character at a time. Teams will take turns in this way until all of their characters have acted, then will do so again during the next round. Players can choose to take their turns in any order, and may change the order in which they take their turns during each subsequent round.

For example: Four players attempt to sneak up on two guards. They fail to be stealthy and alert the guards who begin to attack the players. All six characters will roll for initiative. One of the players rolled the highest initiative so their team will go first. Player #1 will act, then Guard #1, Player #2, Guard #2, Player #3, and finally Player #4. The team containing the players had more characters to act, but each team's members still get to act.

#### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. During each round each character will be able perform up to their entire turn's worth of actions.

When the rules refer to a number of rounds, this means from the start of the turn in which that duration began to the start of a turn in a future round. This means that a one round long effect ends at the beginning of a character's next turn, but before they take any actions.

#### Complex Challenges

Some encounters are considered complex challenges: there is a limited amount of time to complete them, or a series of skill checks are required to overcome them. In these encounters the exact duration of a player's turn is abstract and non-specific. Since players will usually be performing skill checks, the average duration of a turn is the average time it takes to perform all of the player's skill checks and minor actions (assuming they all take about the same amount of time).

Most basic combat scenarios can be considered complex challenges rather than tactical combat encounters. In these situations it is more common for simple enemies to go down in a single hit, while elite enemies will require more significant damage before becoming defeated.

### Actions

During an encounter with more concrete turn length (such as a tactical combat), any action that you take uses a specific portion of your turn. This is called the *action speed* and is measured by a number of actions points ranging from 0 to 3, and each turn you will have 3 action points to spend on actions.

The first time each turn that you perform an action with a speed of 0 it costs 0, however, additional actions with a speed of 0 have their cost increased to 1 for the rest of that turn.

Some actions may require more than 3 action points. If they do, it means they will take multiple turns to complete. Once started they may be cancelled at any point in their duration, so long as it is your turn.

Additionally there are also *reactions* and *free reactions*. Reactions are special actions that do not take up a portion of your turn, but instead happen during another character's turn. You may only take a single reaction each round, and only if you meet the conditions to use that reaction. There is no limit on the number of free reactions that can be taken each round.

In addition to the following basic actions, characters may perform other special actions provided by skills and talents, such as maneuvers or spells.

#### Attack

**Action Speed:** 1

Make an attack on a target with one of your wielded weapons or with your bare hands.

When making an attack, first roll your appropriate combat skill against your target's deflection. A result of a graze or better is considered a hit.

On a hit, you then roll your weapon's damage. Damage from successful hits are reduced by the target's damage reduction. Damage from grazing hits are reduced by half (rounded up) or the target's damage reduction (whichever reduces more damage). The minimum amount of damage that is dealt by a hit is 1 damage. Critical hits both ignore damage reduction and deal bonus damage as specified by the weapon used.

<!--
On a hit, you then roll your weapon's damage. Both grazing hits and successful hits are reduced by the target's damage reduction. Damage from grazing hits are then further reduced by half. The minimum amount of damage that is dealt by a hit is 1 damage. Critical hits both ignore damage reduction and deal bonus damage as specified by the weapon used.
-->

Additional attacks made during the same turn get a -5 penalty to hit for each attack made before it in the same turn. This penalty applies to all forms of attack actions (such as maneuvers) except reactions (such as by a readied action). This is known as the *multiple attack penalty*.

Attacks made against enemies who cannot see you, or who are surrounded on two opposite sides, are made with advantage. These are known as *sneak attacks* and *flanking attacks* respectively. You do not need to be contributing to a flank to make a flanking attack. If you make an attack that is both a sneak attack and a flanking attack it will provide you double advantage on that attack roll.

#### Block

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free Reaction

If you would be hit, you may use your shield to block an incoming attack in front of you. If you do, the shield is considered hit instead, and any damage taken is dealt to your shield's durability instead of you and is reduced by the block value of that shield. Critical hits get half of their bonus damage against blocked hits. Any on hit effects from that hit are given to your shield instead if possible, otherwise they cause no effect.

If the shield would be dealt damage in excess of the shield's durability, the remaining damage is dealt directly to you as a successful hit reduced by your armour's damage reduction (to a minimum of 1).

Shields with no durability are considered broken and cannot be used to block or parry until they are repaired.

#### Brandish

**Action Speed:** 0

Choose which of your items you are wielding in your hands. This can be items from your inventory, or items found in your immediate area.

#### Drop Prone

**Action Speed:** 0

You become prone. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. While prone your movement speed is halved.

#### Evade

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free Reaction or Reaction

Roll your evasion to defend against an attack instead of using your deflection. If the incoming attack grazes against your evasion roll, it is considered a failure instead. After you evade, you may drop prone. You may evade as a reaction instead of a free reaction to move up to 1m instead of dropping prone.

#### Interact

**Action Speed:** Variable

This action covers most basic actions, like opening doors, activating wielded items, or using objects in the immediate area. Unless an object specifies, or a task requires an extended amount of time to perform, this action is considered a swift action.

#### Move

**Stamina Cost:** 0 or 1  
**Action Speed:** 0 or 1

Move a distance up to your speed. If you move more than 1m, this has an action speed of 1, otherwise it is 0. Additionally, this action costs 1 stamina if it is not the first time you have used it during your turn.

If the terrain you are moving over is rough or difficult to navigate, then you can only move half as far over that terrain. If your speed is 1m or less, you can still move at least 1m over difficult terrain per move action.

If your speed is reduced to 1m or less, you cannot move 1m at an action speed of 0. This includes moving 1m over difficult terrain, if your speed is reduced to 2m or less.

#### Parry

**Stamina Cost:** 1  
**Action Speed:** Free Reaction

Use a wielded item with the parry feature to defend against an attack, adding its parry value to your deflection. If the incoming attack grazes against your deflection roll, it is considered a failure instead.

#### Ready an Action

**Action Speed:** 2

Declare any action with a speed of 0 to 2 to use as a reaction given a specified trigger of your choice.

For example: while standing at the end of a hallway, you can ready an attack action against any targets that come into view (such as from a room attached to that hallway). Readied actions are performed immediately, even if that means they might happen in the middle of, or before, another action. This can include spells, maneuvers, or any other special abilities.

#### Rise From Prone

**Action Speed:** 1

You cancel the effects of prone. Ranged and melee attacks against you are made as normal, and your movement speed is restored.

#### Seek Cover

**Action Speed:** 0 or 1

If you are next to a barricade, or the edge of a wall, or some similar structure, you can seek cover behind that object. While being provided cover, you are considered to be partially concealed from ranged enemies until your next turn, giving disadvantage to ranged actions made against your deflection and evasion.

You may also use this action at an action speed of 0 if you have moved more than once during your turn. If you do, you do not need to hide behind an obstacle to get the benefits; it is as though you are using your speed and movement to avoid being targeted from a distance.

#### Use Skill

**Action Speed:** Variable

Skills can be performed as normal during any type of encounter. The exact duration that a skill takes to perform is the same as it would be during any complex challenge. Some skills may take more than a few minutes to complete. This means that most characters who attempt to use complex skills during an encounter may find themselves unable to perform other actions until the action is completed (unless they leave their attempt as incomplete).

## Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, trap, or by any means, they will take damage. Before any damage is dealt, it is reduced by their damage reduction or by half if the hit that dealt damage was a graze (whichever reduces more damage). No matter how much damage reduction a character has, the minimum amount of damage they must take is 1.

Any damage dealt to a character is taken first to their endurance, and then the difference to their health if no endurance remains. When a character is dealt damage, if they would then have zero endurance and are reduced to less than zero health (health can be negative), that character is given the dying condition. If they are reduced to exactly zero health, they are only given the unconscious condition.

Attacks made by weapons with the nonlethal feature cause a creature to be given the unconscious condition instead of the dying condition when applicable. If nonlethal attacks bring a character to negative health equal to their maximum health, then they are given the dying condition.

Damaging items or objects is done by making the relevant skill checks against a difficulty value based on the perceived difficulty to break that item or object (as determined by the Game Master).

For example: breaking a door with an axe would be an Athletics or Martial check against an arbitrary difficulty value (if the door was made of wood, it would likely be easy).

Damage that is halved or doubled multiple times are modified at an altered rate. If damage would be halved twice, it is instead reduced into a third. If it would be halved again, it is reduced to a quarter, and so on. Similarly, if damage is doubled twice, it is instead increased to a triple. If it would be douled again, it is increased to a quadruple, and so on.

### Damage Types

There are three main categories of damage types: *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless*.

The majority of damage is dealt as physical damage, which has three types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Most sources of damage will deal one of these three types of damage.

Most other damage is dealt as elemental damage. By default, all elemental damage bypasses damage reduction unless otherwise specified, or it is blocked. The types of elemental damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*.

Any time a damage type is not listed as one of the physical or elemental damage types it can be considered typeless damage. Since typeless damage effectively has no type, it will always bypass all damage reduction. Typeless damage is very rare.

## Effects

The duration of any given effect is determined by the source of that effect. Unless otherwise specified by the source of the effect, or the effect itself, the effect is permanent. Most effects are typically temporary.

Temporary effects that alter your primary stats, do not also alter your resource stats. They only change derived stats that rely on rolling that primary stat. Permanent effects that alter your primary stats, however, do alter your resource stats.

For example: A character with a strength of r12 is given an effect with alters their size, increasing their strength by +2. This results in a strength of r12+2, which changes their athletics, fortitude, and damage rolls, but it does not change their maximum health from 12 to 14.

Multiple effects of the same type do not stack unless otherwise specified.

#### Blind

Blinded characters suffer a disadvantage to all rolls that require that character to attack, interact with, brandish, or use special abilities at, a specified target. This does not count for interacting with or brandishing their own personal items. In addition to this, all terrain is difficult to move across.

#### Burning

Burning objects are dangerous and likely to cause nearby objects to continue to burn if not contained or extinguished. Burning characters suffer damage over time.

When applied to a character, burning is an effect that has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. If a burning character has burning applied to them, add the burning values together. At the beginning of a burning character's turn, they take fire damage equal to r4 plus r2 for every degree of burning beyond the first, then the burning effect decreases by 1, until it goes away entirely. Burning 1 would be r4 damage, while burning 3 would be r8 damage. Damage from burning bypasses all damage reduction. Dousing a target in water will completely remove the burning.

#### Debilitation

A debilitation is an effect that applies to one of your stats. Debilitated stats are rolled with disadvantage. Multiple debilitations to the same stat do not stack.

#### Dying

When a character is given the dying effect they are also become unconscious. At the start of each turn that a character is dying, they must make a fortitude check versus a difficulty equal to their negative health. If that character succeeds three times, they lose the dying condition, but remain unconscious. If they fail three times, they die. Criticals count as two successes, and grazes count as neither a success or failure. Successes and failures do not need to be consecutive. Stabilized characters remain at negative health. At the end of every round that a character is dying they lose one more health.

#### Encumbered

Encumbered characters are carrying too much. They get a disadvantage to both strength and dexterity, and have halved speed.

#### Enhancement

An enhancement is an effect that applies to one of your stats. Enhanced stats are rolled with advantage. Multiple enhancements to the same stat do not stack.

#### Overencumbered

Overencumbered characters suffer the same effects as encumbered characters, but instead of moving at half speed, they cannot move at all.

#### Prone

Prone characters are either kneeling or laying down on the ground. Ranged attacks against prone characters are made with disadvantage, but melee attacks are made with advantage. You must spend a swift action to stand up from being prone.

#### Sickness

Sickness is an effect that has multiple degrees, as specified by a number. This number is a penalty that you take to *all* of your rolls. Additionally, every day that passes while you are sick you lose health (after recovering health from resting, if applicable) equal to half this sickness value (rounded up). Stamina, focus, and endurance recovered during rests are also reduced by half this value (rounded up) to a minimum of one.

For example: If you have a sickness of 3 and you take a long rest, you will recover 1 health, then lose 2. You will also recover 2 less stamina, focus, and endurance during that rest.

Multiple sickness effects do not add their degree of effect together, instead only apply a penalty based on the strongest sickness effect. Multiple sources of sickness are still tracked separately.

If a sickness effect does not specify a duration, that duration is assumed to be 1 week. After reaching this duration the sickened character will roll a fortitude check to resist the sickness. If successful, the degree of effect is reduced by 1. If no difficulty is specified, it is assumed to be 10 (moderate).

#### Stunned

At the beginning of a stunned character's turn, they lose the stunned effect and 1 action point. Until then, stunned characters cannot perform reactions.

A character can become stunned multiple times, causing them to lose more action points at the beginning of their turn. Regardless of how many times a character is stunned, they will entirely lose the stun effect when their turn begins.

For example: A character manages to become stunned four times before their next turn. At the beginning of their turn they will lose 4 action points (their whole turn), and no longer be stunned. They may still perform an action with a speed of 0.

If a character is in the middle of an action or readying an action and they become stunned, then that action becomes interrupted and will not be performed.

#### Unconscious

Unconscious characters can perform no actions. Loud noises or other disrupting behaviour may awaken an unconscious individual. When a character becomes unconscious they also become prone.

## Concentration

Some abilities or effects may require you to maintain *concentration*. Concentration can only be used to maintain a single ability or effect at a time. If at any point you are required to maintain concentration on multiple effects at once, you must choose one to maintain and the rest to lose. In a way concentration acts like a limited resource, but you never lose the ability to concentrate by spending it.

Concentration requires an active and conscious mind. If at any point you become unconscious, you automatically lose your concentration. If you become stunned, you may make a willpower check against the source that provided the stun. If successful, the concentration is maintained. If the source does not have a difficulty value, then make the check against a difficulty of 10 instead.

## Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities acquired by advancing combat skills. Each combat skill has access to different maneuvers.

### Acquiring Maneuvers

Whenever you become trained in a new combat skill, you acquire a maneuver from that specialization. These specializations match the combat skills. You gain additional maneuvers for every two rank advancements beyond the first rank in the same skill. Maneuvers cost stamina and can only be used once each round. Any characters that start with combat skills also start with maneuvers based on their advancement in that skill. Maneuvers gained from advancing one combat skill can be used by your other combat skills, so long as they could also be learned by that skill.

For example: You advanced your Unarmed skill and learned Heavy Strike. Since you are also trained in Martial, you can also use Heavy Strike with the Martial skill.

Click [here](/Core/Maneuvers.md) for the list of maneuvers.

Maneuvers also have a listed type, which can be one of: *offensive*, *defensive*, or *tactical*. Typically, offensive maneuvers perform attacks, defensive maneuvers defend yourself or others, and tactical maneuvers provide special actions.

### Performing Maneuvers

When you perform a maneuver on a target it may have a chance for the target to resist the effects of that maneuver. They will roll the skill or stat listed to make an opposed check against your attack roll. If the attacker grazes against the resist, the effects are applied at half duration (if any, rounded down). Otherwise it is simply considered a failure instead, and the defender suffers no effects. Any attacks are still made on the target even if they resist the effects of the maneuver.

For example: You perform a Crippling Strike against a target. First you make an attack, then if the attack hits or grazes, the target rolls to resist. If your maneuver's roll to hit is a 12 and the defender's resist is a 14, the maneuver grazed against their resist. Crippling Strike's effect only lasts 1 round instead of 2.

### Improvising Maneuvers

Although maneuvers must normally be learned in order to use, you may also improvise maneuvers. If you do improvise a maneuver, you perform the manuever as normal but with an additional cost of your choice: either the stamina cost is increased by 1, or the action speed is increased by 1 if it was from 0 to 2.

For example: You do not have the Feint maneuver, but intend to improvise it. You do not want to waste any stamina, so you perform it at a speed of 2 instead of 1.

## Resting

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources (health, endurance, stamina, and focus). In order to restore these resources, you need to rest. There are two different types of rest: the short rest and the long rest. Depending on the type of rest performed, you will recover a different amount of spent resources.

##### Table: Rest Recovery Rates
| Resource | Short Rest | Long Rest |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Health | None | 1 |
| Endurance | Min FORT | Max FORT ×½ |
| Stamina | Min INIT | Max INIT ×½ |
| Focus | Min WILL | Max WILL ×½ |

You can calculate the minimum of a stat by counting the number of dice you would roll and then adding any bonuses.

For example: If you have a Fortitude of r22+1, that would be a ten-sided-die and a twelve-sided-die. Two dice plus the modifier of 1 results in a minimum roll that is 3. 

If the amount of a resource recovered during a rest would be greater than the maximum amount you can have of that resource type, it would recover that amount instead.

For example: If you have a maximum Stamina of 10, but half your maximum Initiative is 12, then you will only ever recover up to 10 Stamina during a long rest.

### Short Rest

A short rest is basically a break from strenuous activity. Whenever you take a break to relax, meditate, or make preparations over a period of thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a short rest.

An extended period up to about two hours containing a single simple activity, such as performing research or crafting an item with a very low difficulty (of 5 or less) can also be considered a short rest.

### Long Rest

A long rest requires about eight hours of sleep. If a long rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered incomplete and only half of the normal resources are restored. The long rest may be resumed to restore the remaining resources.

Characters with substantial wounds will require substantial rest to recover. Characters may treat the wounds of a character performing a long rest by using the medicine skill against a difficulty of 10 (Moderate). This is increased to 15 (Hard) if they have negative health. If successful, the amount of health that character recovers during that long rest is increased by 1 (to 2).

Abilties that can be used a number of times per rest are restored after a complete long rest.

For the purpose of recovering resources, any short rests not taken during the day are considered taken during a long rest.

For example: If you took a single short rest (of the two permitted), then took a long rest at the end of the day, you would recover your resources during that long rest as if it was combined with an additional short rest. If you didn't take any short rests during the day, then it would be as if all of your rests were combined.

### Rest Limitations

Characters can only physically rest so often and are limited to a number of rests per day. A long rest is effectively sleep and each character must take one long rest each day. Tracking exhaustion for sleepless nights is an [optional rule](/Advanced/AdvancedAilments.md#fatigue). Short rests are optional, and a character may take up to two short rests each day.
