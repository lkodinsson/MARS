# Encounters and Abilities

## Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* If two or more characters or creatures intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger, and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is limited time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All characters roll their initiative.
2. If it is combat, determine which characters are aware of their opponents. If these characters are aware of their opponents, but not the other way around, they can act during a surprise round.
3. Characters who are not surprised engage in a surprise round, which functions just like a normal round except all surprised characters do not get to take turns.
4. After the surprise round (if any), all teams take turns one character each, until all characters have acted. This then repeats until the encounter ends.

#### Initiative

When it comes time to begin an encounter each character will roll their *initiative*, which is their *dexterity* plus their *resolve*. The team with the highest individual iniative goes first. On a tie, the Game Master decides who goes first (usually favouring the player team). Each team will take turn choosing one character to act, and will alternate until all characters have acted. Players can choose to take their turns in any order, and may change the order in which they take their turns during each subsequent round. For example: Four players attempt to sneak up on two guards. They fail to be stealthy and alert the guards who begin to attack the players. All six characters will roll for initiative. One of the players rolled the highest initiative so their team will go first. Player #1 will act, then Guard #1, Player #2, Guard #2, Player #3, and finally Player #4. The team containing the players had more characters to act, but each team's members still get to act.

#### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. During each round each character will be able perform up to their entire turn's worth of actions. When the rules refer to a number of rounds, this means from the start of a player's the turn in which that duration began to the start of their turn in a future round, but before they take any actions.

In other cases, encounters which can be better described as complex challenges do not require an exact duration of a player's turn. Instead, there is simply a series of challenges to overcome in a given time frame. In this way, players are simply performing a serious of skill checks in addition to any other minor actions (assuming all player's spend roughly the same amount of time.)

<!-- The most basic combat scenarios may be considered complex challenges rather than tactical combat encounters if the results of that combat have minimal consequences. This can allow those combats to be more narrative than tactical. In these situations it is more common for simple enemies to go down in a single hit, while elite enemies will require more significant damage before becoming defeated. -->
<!-- The above information is probably more useful in a GMG than here. -->

## Actions

During an encounter with concrete turn length (such as tactical combat) you can perform up to three actions during your turn, with some tasks requiring the cost of multiple of these actions to be performed. Actions that are long enough to take longer than a single turn (so more than three actions) are considered *extended actions*. When an extended action is started, it can be cancelled at any point during one of your future turns before it finishes. There are also faster actions called *free actions* which do not take up one of your three actions during your turn. Only once during each of your turns can you take a *free action* for free. Any additional free actions taken during the same turn are instead considered normal actions thus taking up one of your three actions for the turn.

Outside of the normal turn order sometimes actions can still be performed as *reactions*, which may only be performed once per round. That is from the start of your turn to the start of your next turn. These types of actions have a condition or a trigger which allows you to take that reaction. For example: the *evade* action is a reaction that allows you to use your evasion instead of your deflection when you are targeted by an attack. Certain types of reactions (including evade) are also considered *free reactions* which are not limited to once per round, and do not limit you from using a normal reaction.

Actions provided from sources like from skills, talents, maneuvers, or spells, will usually list how long they take (as action points) to perform. If they do not, it is up to the Game Master to determine how long they would take given the context of the encounter.

#### Group Actions

Sometimes multiple players will want to perform the same type of action. In this case, they will all roll the same skill check for that action, but only the best or worst (depending on the circumstance) result will be used. For example: If multiple characters are searching a room for an secret door or hidden object, only one of them needs to succeed. However, if multiple characters are trying to remain quiet to not be detected, all of them may need to succeed.

## Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, trap, or by any means, they will take damage. Before any damage is dealt, it is reduced by their damage reduction or by half if the hit that dealt damage was a graze (whichever reduces more damage). No matter how much damage reduction a character has, the minimum amount of damage they must take is 1. Any damage dealt to a character is taken first to their endurance, and then the difference to their health if no endurance remains. When a character is dealt damage, if they would then have zero endurance and are reduced to less than zero health (health can be negative), that character is given the dying condition. If they are reduced to exactly zero health, they are only given the unconscious condition.

Attacks made by weapons with the nonlethal feature cause a creature to be given the unconscious condition instead of the dying condition when applicable. If nonlethal attacks bring a character to negative health equal to their maximum health, then they are given the dying condition.

Damaging items or objects is done by making the relevant skill checks against a difficulty value based on the perceived difficulty to break that item or object (as determined by the Game Master). For example: breaking a door with an axe could be an athletics or martial check against an arbitrary difficulty value (if the door was made of wood, it could be easy).

Damage that is halved or doubled multiple times are modified at an altered rate. If damage would be halved twice, it is instead reduced into a third. If it would be halved again, it is reduced to a quarter, and so on. Similarly, if damage is doubled twice, it is instead increased to a triple. If it would be douled again, it is increased to a quadruple, and so on.

#### Damage Types

There are three main categories of damage types: *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless*. The majority of damage is dealt as physical damage, which has three types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Most sources of damage will deal one of these three types of damage. Most other damage is dealt as elemental damage. By default, all elemental damage bypasses damage reduction unless otherwise specified, or it is blocked. The types of elemental damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*. Any time a damage type is not listed as one of the physical or elemental damage types it can be considered typeless damage. Typeless damage also bypass damage reduction, but it is also very rare.

## Conditions

The duration of any given condition is determined by its source. Unless otherwise specified by its source or the condition itself the effect is permanent, but most conditions are typically temporary. Multiple conditions of the same type do not stack unless otherwise specified.

Temporary conditions that alter your primary stats, do not also alter your resource stats. They only change derived values that rely on rolling that primary stat (like skill checks). For example: A character with a strength of r12 is given an effect with alters their size, increasing their strength by +2. This results in a strength of r12+2, which changes their athletics, fortitude, and damage rolls, but it does not change their maximum health from 12 to 14.

In contrast, permanent condition that alter your primary stats do alter your resource stats. For example: If you were given a permanent disease or injury giving you a -2 to your strength, then you would need to reduce your maximum health (as well as your athletics, fortitude, and damage rolls).

## Concentration

Some abilities or effects may require you to maintain *concentration*. Concentration can only be used to maintain a single ability or effect at a time. If at any point you are required to maintain concentration on multiple effects at once, you must choose one to maintain and the rest to lose. In a way concentration acts like a limited resource, but you never lose the ability to concentrate by spending it.

Concentration requires an active and conscious mind. If at any point you become unconscious, you automatically lose your concentration. If you become stunned, you may make a willpower check against the source that provided the stun. If successful, the concentration is maintained. If the source does not have a difficulty value, then make the check against a difficulty of 10 instead.

## Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities acquired by advancing combat skills. Each combat skill has access to different maneuvers.

### Acquiring Maneuvers

Whenever you become trained in a new combat skill, you acquire a maneuver from that specialization. These specializations match the combat skills. You gain additional maneuvers for every two rank advancements beyond the first rank in the same skill. Maneuvers cost stamina and can only be used once each round. Any characters that start with combat skills also start with maneuvers based on their advancement in that skill. Maneuvers gained from advancing one combat skill can be used by your other combat skills, so long as they could also be learned by that skill.

For example: You advanced your Unarmed skill and learned Heavy Strike. Since you are also trained in Martial, you can also use Heavy Strike with the Martial skill.

Click [here](/Core/Maneuvers.md) for the list of maneuvers.

Maneuvers also have a listed type, which can be one of: *offensive*, *defensive*, or *tactical*. Typically, offensive maneuvers perform attacks, defensive maneuvers defend yourself or others, and tactical maneuvers provide special actions.

### Performing Maneuvers

When you perform a maneuver on a target it may have a chance for the target to resist the effects of that maneuver. They will roll the skill or stat listed to make an opposed check against your attack roll. If the attacker grazes against the resist, the effects are applied at half duration (if any, rounded down). Otherwise it is simply considered a failure instead, and the defender suffers no effects. Any attacks are still made on the target even if they resist the effects of the maneuver.

For example: You perform a Crippling Strike against a target. First you make an attack, then if the attack hits or grazes, the target rolls to resist. If your maneuver's roll to hit is a 12 and the defender's resist is a 14, the maneuver grazed against their resist. Crippling Strike's effect only lasts 1 round instead of 2.

### Improvising Maneuvers

Although maneuvers must normally be learned in order to use, you may also improvise maneuvers. If you do improvise a maneuver, you perform the manuever as normal but with an additional cost of your choice: either the stamina cost is increased by 1, or the action speed is increased by 1 if it was from 0 to 2.

For example: You do not have the Feint maneuver, but intend to improvise it. You do not want to waste any stamina, so you perform it at a speed of 2 instead of 1.

## Resting

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources (health, endurance, stamina, and focus). In order to restore these resources, you need to rest. There are two different types of rest: the short rest and the long rest. Depending on the type of rest performed, you will recover a different amount of spent resources.

##### Table: Rest Recovery Rates
| Resource | Short Rest | Long Rest |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Health | None | 1 |
| Endurance | Min FORT | Max FORT ×½ |
| Stamina | Min INIT | Max INIT ×½ |
| Focus | Min WILL | Max WILL ×½ |

You can calculate the minimum of a stat by counting the number of dice you would roll and then adding any bonuses.

For example: If you have a Fortitude of r22+1, that would be a ten-sided-die and a twelve-sided-die. Two dice plus the modifier of 1 results in a minimum roll that is 3. 

If the amount of a resource recovered during a rest would be greater than the maximum amount you can have of that resource type, it would recover that amount instead.

For example: If you have a maximum Stamina of 10, but half your maximum Initiative is 12, then you will only ever recover up to 10 Stamina during a long rest.

#### Short Rest

A short rest is basically a break from strenuous activity. Whenever you take a break to relax, meditate, or make preparations over a period of thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a short rest.

An extended period up to about two hours containing a single simple activity, such as performing research or crafting an item with a very low difficulty (of 5 or less) can also be considered a short rest.

#### Long Rest

A long rest requires about eight hours of sleep. If a long rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered incomplete and only half of the normal resources are restored. The long rest may be resumed to restore the remaining resources.

Characters with substantial wounds will require substantial rest to recover. Characters may treat the wounds of a character performing a long rest by using the medicine skill against a difficulty of 10 (Moderate). This is increased to 15 (Hard) if they have negative health. If successful, the amount of health that character recovers during that long rest is increased by 1 (to 2).

Abilties that can be used a number of times per rest are restored after a complete long rest.

For the purpose of recovering resources, any short rests not taken during the day are considered taken during a long rest.

For example: If you took a single short rest (of the two permitted), then took a long rest at the end of the day, you would recover your resources during that long rest as if it was combined with an additional short rest. If you didn't take any short rests during the day, then it would be as if all of your rests were combined.

#### Rest Limitations

Characters can only physically rest so often and are limited to a number of rests per day. A long rest is effectively sleep and each character must take one long rest each day. Tracking exhaustion for sleepless nights is an [optional rule](/Advanced/AdvancedAilments.md#fatigue). Short rests are optional, and a character may take up to two short rests each day.
