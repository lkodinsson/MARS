# Encounters and Abilities

## Encounters

Encounters are time-sensitive scenarios where each action you take matters. Encounters typically begin in a few different ways:

* If two or more characters or creatures intend to perform actions that oppose each other (combat and non-combat).
* When a character is aware of a potential danger, and intends to be deliberate and calculating with their actions.
* When there is limited time to overcome a complex challenge.

Encounters from start to end follow this sequence:

1. All characters roll their initiative.
2. If it is combat, determine which characters are aware of their opponents. If these characters are aware of their opponents, but not the other way around, they can act during a surprise round.
3. Characters who are not surprised engage in a surprise round, which functions just like a normal round except all surprised characters do not get to take turns.
4. After the surprise round (if any), all teams take turns one character each, until all characters have acted. This then repeats until the encounter ends.

#### Initiative

When it comes time to begin an encounter each character will roll their *initiative*, which is their *dexterity* plus their *resolve*. The team with the highest individual iniative goes first. On a tie, the Game Master decides who goes first (usually favouring the player team). Each team will take turn choosing one character to act, and will alternate until all characters have acted. Players can choose to take their turns in any order, and may change the order in which they take their turns during each subsequent round. For example: Four players attempt to sneak up on two guards. They fail to be stealthy and alert the guards who begin to attack the players. All six characters will roll for initiative. One of the players rolled the highest initiative so their team will go first. Player #1 will act, then Guard #1, Player #2, Guard #2, Player #3, and finally Player #4. The team containing the players had more characters to act, but each team's members still get to act.

#### Rounds

Each round represents about six seconds in the game world, meaning there are 10 rounds in a minute. During each round each character will be able perform up to their entire turn's worth of actions. When the rules refer to a number of rounds, this means from the start of a player's the turn in which that duration began to the start of their turn in a future round, but before they take any actions.

In other cases, encounters which can be better described as complex challenges do not require an exact duration of a player's turn. Instead, there is simply a series of challenges to overcome in a given time frame. In this way, players are simply performing a serious of skill checks in addition to any other minor actions (assuming all player's spend roughly the same amount of time.)

<!-- The most basic combat scenarios may be considered complex challenges rather than tactical combat encounters if the results of that combat have minimal consequences. This can allow those combats to be more narrative than tactical. In these situations it is more common for simple enemies to go down in a single hit, while elite enemies will require more significant damage before becoming defeated. -->
<!-- The above information is probably more useful in a GMG rather than here. -->

## Actions

During an encounter with concrete turn length (such as tactical combat) you can perform up to three actions during your turn, with some tasks requiring the cost of multiple of these actions to be performed. Actions that are long enough to take longer than a single turn (so more than three actions) are considered *extended actions*. When an extended action is started, it can be cancelled at any point during one of your future turns before it finishes. There are also faster actions called *free actions* which do not take up one of your three actions during your turn. Only once during each of your turns can you take a *free action* for free. Any additional free actions taken during the same turn are instead considered normal actions thus taking up one of your three actions for the turn.

Outside of the normal turn order sometimes actions can still be performed as *reactions*, which may only be performed once per round. That is from the start of your turn to the start of your next turn. These types of actions have a condition or a trigger which allows you to take that reaction. For example: the *evade* action is a reaction that allows you to use your evasion instead of your deflection when you are targeted by an attack. Certain types of reactions (including evade) are also considered *free reactions* which are not limited to once per round, and do not limit you from using a normal reaction.

Actions provided from sources like from skills, talents, maneuvers, or spells, will usually list how long they take (as action points) to perform. If they do not, it is up to the Game Master to determine how long they would take given the context of the encounter.

<sup>Click [here](/Appendix/Actions) for the list of actions.</sup>

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of talents or other special abilities, these aspects of your character are more under you control. Instead you declare exactly what ability you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action. For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* which may require you to roll an athletics check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast the spell Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

#### Group Actions

Sometimes multiple players will want to perform the same type of action. In this case, they will all roll the same skill check for that action, but only the best or worst (depending on the circumstance) result will be used. For example: If multiple characters are searching a room for an secret door or hidden object, only one of them needs to succeed. However, if multiple characters are trying to remain quiet to not be detected, all of them may need to succeed.

## Concentration

Some abilities or effects may require you to maintain *concentration*. Concentration can only be used to maintain a single ability or effect at a time. If at any point you are required to maintain concentration on multiple effects at once, you must choose one to maintain and the rest to lose. In a way concentration acts like a limited resource, but you never lose the ability to concentrate by spending it.

Concentration requires an active and conscious mind. If at any point you become unconscious, you automatically lose your concentration. If you become stunned, you may make a willpower check against the source that provided the stun. If successful, the concentration is maintained. If the source does not have a difficulty value, then make the check against a difficulty of 15 instead. On a graze, concentration to maintain that effect is reduced to a limited duration of one round (or 6 seconds). If so, the concentration can be reset by reactivating the ability which provided the effect before the duration is met.

## Damage

When a character is hit by an attack, trap, or by any means, they will take damage. Before any damage is dealt, it is reduced by the character's damage reduction. No matter how much damage reduction a character has, the minimum amount of damage they must take is 1. Any damage dealt to a character is taken first to their endurance, and then the difference to their health if no endurance remains. When a character is dealt damage, if they would then have zero endurance and are reduced to less than zero health (health can be negative), that character is given the dying condition. If they are reduced to exactly zero health, they are only given the unconscious condition.

Attacks made by weapons with the nonlethal feature cause a creature to be given the unconscious condition instead of the dying condition when applicable. If nonlethal attacks bring a character to negative health equal to their maximum health, then they are given the dying condition.

Damaging items or objects is done by making the relevant skill checks against a difficulty value based on the perceived difficulty to break that item or object (as determined by the Game Master). For example: breaking a door with an axe could be an athletics or martial check against an arbitrary difficulty value (if the door was made of wood, it could be easy).

Damage that is halved or doubled multiple times are modified at an altered rate. If damage would be halved twice, it is instead reduced into a third. If it would be halved again, it is reduced to a quarter, and so on. Similarly, if damage is doubled twice, it is instead increased to a triple. If it would be douled again, it is increased to a quadruple, and so on.

#### Damage Types

There are three main categories of damage types: *physical*, *elemental*, and *typeless*. The majority of damage is dealt as physical damage, which has three types: *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, and *slashing*. Most sources of damage will deal one of these three types of damage. Most other damage is dealt as elemental damage. By default, all elemental damage bypasses damage reduction unless otherwise specified, or it is blocked. The types of elemental damage are: *arcane*, *cold*, *electric*, *fire*, *radiant*, and *void*. Any time a damage type is not listed as one of the physical or elemental damage types it can be considered typeless damage. Typeless damage also bypass damage reduction, but it is also very rare.

## Conditions

The duration of any given condition is determined by its source. Unless otherwise specified by its source or the condition itself the effect is permanent, but most conditions are typically temporary. Multiple conditions of the same type do not stack unless otherwise specified.

Temporary conditions that alter your primary stats, do not also alter your resource stats. They only change derived values that rely on rolling that primary stat (like skill checks). For example: A character with a strength of r12 is given an effect with alters their size, increasing their strength by +2. This results in a strength of r12+2, which changes their athletics, fortitude, and damage rolls, but it does not change their maximum health from 12 to 14.

In contrast, permanent condition that alter your primary stats do alter your resource stats. For example: If you were given a permanent disease or injury giving you a -2 to your strength, then you would need to reduce your maximum health (as well as your athletics, fortitude, and damage rolls).

## Maneuvers

Maneuvers are special abilities acquired by advancing combat skills. Each combat skill has access to different maneuvers, each being considered maneuver specialization. Maneuvers have various types: *offensive*, *defensive*, or *tactical*. Typically, offensive maneuvers perform attacks, defensive maneuvers defend yourself or others, and tactical maneuvers provide special actions.

<sup>Click [here](/Features/Maneuvers) for the list of maneuvers.</sup>

<!--
#### Acquiring Maneuvers

Whenever you become trained in a new combat skill, you acquire a maneuver from that specialization. These specializations match the combat skills. You gain additional maneuvers for every two rank advancements beyond the first rank in the same skill. Maneuvers cost stamina and can only be used once each round. Any characters that start with combat skills also start with maneuvers based on their advancement in that skill. Maneuvers gained from advancing one combat skill can be used by your other combat skills, so long as they could also be learned by that skill. For example: You advanced your Unarmed skill and learned Heavy Strike. Since you are also trained in Martial, you can also use Heavy Strike with the Martial skill.

<sup>Click [here](/Features/Maneuvers.md) for the list of maneuvers.</sup>
-->

#### Performing Maneuvers

Normally, before a maneuver can be performed it must first be learned by advancing the relevant combat skill. This occurs both during character creation and later during character advancement. Performing a maneuver usually has two parts: an attack and an effect. Each maneuver will list the order these things occur and how they interact with the target. Effects can be resisted by the target similar to how attacks can be defended. They will roll the stat or skill listed for the resist against your attack roll. If your attack roll grazes against the resist, the effects are applied at half duration (if any, rounded down). Otherwise the effect is simply considered a failure instead, and the defender suffers no effects. Any attacks are still made against the target even if they resist the effects of the maneuver. For example: You perform a Crippling Strike against a target. First you make an attack, then if the attack hits, the target rolls to resist. If your maneuver's roll to hit is a 12 and the defender's resist is a 13, the maneuver grazed against their resist. Crippling Strike's effect only lasts 1 round instead of 2.

#### Improvising Maneuvers

Although maneuvers must normally be learned in order to use, you may also improvise unlearned maneuvers. If you do improvise a maneuver, you perform the maneuver as normal but with an additional cost of your choice: either the stamina cost is increased by 1, or the action type is reduced by one action (if possible). For example: You do not have the Feint maneuver, but intend to improvise it. You do not want to waste any stamina, so it takes two actions instead of one action to use.

In essence, all maneuvers are generally available to all characters, but doing so is very inefficient for the untrained. There are very few maneuvers that cannot be improvised.

## Powers

Powers function very similarly to maneuvers, but are instead manipulations of reality using either magic or some other kind of supernatural influence. There are various different skills that provide powers and each skill has its own list of specializations that have access to different abilities. Many of these specializations do share some of these abilities which means different sources can provide what are essentially the same supernatural effects, even if one is magic and the other not.

<sup>Click [here](/Features/Powers) for the list of powers.</sup>

#### Performing Powers

Although there are many different ways to acquire powers they are all performed the same way:

1. Wait for the complete action time required to use the power.
2. Roll your skill and stat versus the power's difficulty.
3. Regardless of success, spend focus equal to that power's cost.
4. The targets (if any) may roll to resist the effects of that power (if allowed).
5. Perform the effects of that power based on your degree of success versus the target's resist.

Most powers have varying degrees of success based on how well you rolled the same as normal skill checks: *failure*, *graze*, *success*, and *critical success*. Regardless of your degree of success, you may choose to downgrade the success of your ability (your roll is still the same, but you can choose a lower success category). Failure to perform an ability not only causes it to not perform its intended effect, but also causes additional unintended effects. The exact nature of these effects are determined by the Game Master based on the ability attempted. The lowest degree of success you can choose to perform is a graze (you cannot choose to downgrade to a failure). <!--If a power does not specify reduced effects as a graze, then grazes are considered failures instead.-->

If the targets of your power choose to resist, they roll the appropriate stat or skill as specified by that power against the roll you already made to use it. If the targets of that power are granted future opportunities to resist, they will continue to roll resist checks against that same value. Unless a power states otherwise, if it grazes against a resist roll, all effects are negated. Powers that deal damage typically deal reduced damage when grazing against a target's resistance (like attacks) with all other effects being negated.

Additional powers used during the same turn get a -3 penalty for each power used before it in the same turn. This is known as the *multiple power penalty*. Powers used as a reaction are exempt from this penalty (such as by a readied action).

## Recovering

At some point during an adventure you may find yourself low on your resources, and you will need to spend time recovering. There are two different ways to recover: *breaks* and *rests*. Each method will recover a different amount of your spent resources.

##### Table: Recovery Rates
| Resource | Break | Rest |
|:-|:-:|:-:|
| Health | None | 1 |
| Endurance | Minimum Fortitude | Passive Fortitude |
| Stamina | Minimum Initiative | Passive Initiative |
| Focus | Minimum Willpower | Passive Willpower |

You can calculate the minimum by counting the number of dice you would roll plus or minus any modifiers. Similarly, the passive value is half of the roll value plus or minus any modifiers. For example: If you have a fortitude of r22+1, that would be a ten-sided-die and a twelve-sided-die. Two dice plus the modifier of 1 results in a minimum roll that is 3. Half of the roll value is 11 plus the modifier of 1 results in a passive value of 12.

If the amount of a resource recovered would be greater than the maximum amount you can have of that resource type, it will recover up to your maximum instead. For example: If you have a maximum stamina of 10, but your passive initiative is 12, then you will only ever recover up to 10 stamina during a rest.

#### Breaks

A break is basically a short amount of time to relax from strenuous activity. Whenever you go to relax, meditate, or make simple preparations over a period of thirty minutes to an hour, that may be considered a break. An extended period up to about two hours containing a single simple activity, such as performing research or crafting an item with a very low difficulty (of 5 or less) can also be considered a break.

Breaks can only be taken up to two times each day (in between rests).

Characters can only physically rest so often and are limited to a number of rests per day. A long rest is effectively sleep and each character must take one long rest each day.  Short rests are optional, and a character may take up to two short rests each day.

#### Rests

A rest occurs when you sleep uninterrupted for approximately eight hours. If a rest is interrupted part way, then it is considered incomplete and only half of the normal resources are recovered instead. The rest may be resumed within two hours to complete the rest and recover the remaining resources. For the purpose of recovering resources, any breaks not taken during the day are also considered to be taken during the rest, and any abilties that can be used a number of times per rest are also restored after a complete rest. For example: If you took a single break (of the two permitted), then took a rest at the end of the day, you would recover your resources during that rest as if it was combined with the remaining break. If you didn't take any breaks during the day, then it would be as if you took two breaks and rested at the same time.

Characters with substantial wounds will require substantial rest to recover. Characters may treat the wounds of another character before they take a rest by using the medicine skill against a difficulty of 15 (Moderate). This is increased to 20 (Hard) if that character currently has negative health. If successful, the amount of health that character recovers during that rest is increased by 1 (to 2).

Rests can only be taken once each day (usually at night). Tracking exhaustion for sleepless nights is an [optional rule](/Extended_Systems/Advanced_Ailments#fatigue), but it is recommended.
