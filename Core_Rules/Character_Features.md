# Character Features

## Stats

Stats are numerical and fundamental properties of a character, especially physical properties. Stats are split into two categories, *primary stats* and *secondary stats*. Respectively, these stats describe the broad and narrow features of a character.

### Primary Stats

Each character has four *primary stats* which are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve*. All primary stats are represented by roll values usually ranging from r8 to r20.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps
| Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| r8 | Below Average |
| r10 | Average |
| r12 | Above Average |
| r14 | Great |
| r16 | Superb |
| r18 | Powerful |
| r20 | Epic |

Characters typically start with stats ranging from below average (r8) to above average (r12).

<!--
### Strength (STR)

Strength measures physical power, and general vitality. This stat is important for atheletes, labourers, and those who engage in physical contests.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity measures the reaction speed, balance, and precision of your character. It is an important stat for characters who want to be stealthy, perform sleight of hand, tinker with devices, or make attacks.

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons, is for those who want to understand how complex things work, speak many languages, or recall important information. In genres that have magic it also determines a character's capacity for magical energies.

### Resolve (RES)

Resolve is the determination, intuition, and spirituality of your character. It is primarily used for characters who want to persevere through pure force of will, practice the arts or business, or communicate effectively with others.

### Secondary Stats

Characters also have several *secondary stats*: *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, *focus*, *fortitude*, *initiative*, *willpower*, *deflection*, *evasion*, *speed*, and *size*. These stats are derived from other sources, such as your primary stats, other character features, and your equipment. For example: *armour rating* and *damage reduction* are determined by what your character is wearing, while *speed* and *size* are determined by your character's ancestry. The first four of the secondary stats (health, endurance, stamina, and focus) are also considered *resources*. Resources have current and maximum values, and they may be spent or damaged.

<!--
##### Table: Secondary Stats
| Secondary Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Max STR |
| Endurance (ED) | Max RES |
| Stamina (ST) | Max DEX |
| Focus (FP) | Max INT |
| Fortitude (FORT) | STR + RES |
| Initiative (INIT) | DEX + RES |
| Willpower (WILL) | INT + RES |
| Deflection (DEF) | RES + AR |
| Evasion (EVA) | DEX + AR |

For example: if you have a strength of r12, then you have a maximum strength of 12 and therefore 12 health.
-->

#### Resources

Some secondary stats act as resources, and managing these resources allows that character to survive difficult circumstances and perform exceptional abilities. All resource stats are represent by *maximum* and *current* values, where the amount of that resource you can have is limited by its maximum, and may be spent until they run out. *Health* and *endurance* are used to measure how well your character is surviving damage and physical stress, with endurance being easy to recover and health being difficult to recover. The other two resources are spent to perform special abilities, with *stamina* being used for physical abilities and *focus* being used for mental abilities.

#### Reflexes

When things happen to and around your character, some stats are used to measure your character's response to those events. These stats are basically a form of reflex. *Fortitude* prepares your body for a physical challenge, *initiative* prepares the body to move and detect, and *willpower* prepares the mind to assess or resist influence. In some cases the Game Master may even secretly resolve the use of your character's reflexes (especially initiative), if there is any potential that an outcome should be a secret to your character.

#### Defenses

In contrast to reflexes, the defensive stats of *deflection* and *evasion* are active and decided by player choice. In more direct combat encounters, you will have the choice when attacked to use your choice of deflection or evasion. Deflection being the option to take the threat head on, and evasion allowing you the chance to avoid it entirely. Evasion can be the safer option, but it also requires that you spend your stamina.

#### Innate

There are also simplier innate features like the movement *speed* and physical *size* of characters. Different character ancestries are the primary source for these stats, as opposed to primary stats which influence the other secondary stats.

<!--
### Health (HP)

Health, or hit points, are an abstraction representing how healthy a character is at the current moment. Any damage taken to your health represents a serious injury.

### Endurance (ED)

Endurance represents your ability to shrug off potential injuries before suffering serious damage, and is easy to restore with a little rest.

### Stamina (ST)

Stamina is used to perform tricks, maneuvers, and certain physical actions.

### Focus (FP)

Focus is used to use powers, cast spells, and perform special abilities.

### Initiative (INIT)

Initiative is your ability to react first in a moment of conflict, and in other rare circumstances.

### Armour Rating (AR)

Armour rating represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to neutralize incoming attacks. This stat is directly applied to your deflection and evasion.

### Damage Reduction (DR)

Damage reduction represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to reduce the force of incoming successful hits. Any damage you take is reduced by your total damage reduction.

### Deflection (DEF)

Deflection is the capacity to shrug off incoming attacks and abilities before they can even take effect. The use of deflection is often done automatically if no other type of defense is appropriate.

### Evasion (EVA)

Evasion is your ability to quickly avoid danger, rather than relying on deflection to take hits. The use of evasion is often done intentionally rather than automatically relying on other forms of defense.

### Fortitude (FORT)

Fortitude is your ability to resist poison and disease, and many forms of elemental damage like ice and fire. In dire circumstances it is also used to avoid potential death.

### Willpower (WILL)

Willpower is your ability to resist temptation or supernatural influence, both mental and physical. This is not the same as preventing effects that harm the body, but instead those that control the body or mind. Similarly it allows you to judge whether or not someone seems believable. When casting spells it determines the strength of that spell's effect.

### Speed (SPD)

Your speed is a measurement of your average walking distance over six seconds. You can run three times this distance in the same amount of time. This stat also effects other forms of travel, like climbing, swimming, and flying if able. Usually these are performed at half your speed without if you do not have special abilities that state otherwise.

### Size (SZ)

Size is measured in size categories. Most characters will normally be considered medium-sized, however, certain genres may provide you with additional options for playing in different size categories. Your size may provide you with modifiers to some of your other stats.

##### Table: Size & Size Modifiers
| Size | Avg. Height | Avg. Weight | Strength | Dexterity | Speed |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Tiny | ½m~¾m | 5kg~15kg | -3 | +2 | -1 |
| Very Small | ¾m~1m | 15kg~30kg | -2 | +1 | -1 |
| Small | 1m~1½m | 30kg~60kg | -1 | +1 | - |
| Medium | 1½m~2m | 40kg~90kg | - | - | - |
| Large | 2m~2½m | 60kg~150kg | +1 | -1 | - |
| Very Large | 2½m~3m | 90kg~250kg | +2 | -1 | +1 |
| Huge | 3m~4m | 150kg~500kg | +3 | -2 | +1 |

## Skills

Skills represent practice in performing various groups of tasks and make certain types of actions easier for your character to perform. Like primary stats, skill values are represented by roll values. All skills have associated primary stats that are rolled with that skill together whenever they are performed.

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| r4 | Trained |
| r6 | Adept |
| r8 | Practiced |
| r10 | Proficient |
| r12 | Exceptional |
| r14 | Disciplined |
| r16 | Accomplished |
| r18 | Expert |
| r20 | Master |

All characters can use *any* skill even in they are not trained in that skill. If you do, then you will only get any roll value from that skill's associated stat, because untrained skills have no roll value provided. This means that it is very difficult to succeed with any skills untrained, as the difference between trained and untrained is largest individual gap.

### Skill Checks

If you have taken an action and success is not guaranteed, you will need to make a *skill check*. You will roll your skill and associated primary stat together and compare the result to a *difficulty value* determined secretly by the Game Master. The result of any skill check is determined by its relationship to the difficulty value. This can result in varying degrees of success or failure. For example: you attempt to leap over a large pit. This requires an athletics check, which is associated with your strength stat. If you have a strength of r12, and an athletics of r4, you will roll r16. If you were not trained in athletics you would still at least roll your strength of r12.

In other circumstances where two characters are making a comparison of the same skill, those characters will instead need to make *opposed checks*. The results of an opposed check basically only have success or failure for the opposing characters, with the exception of ties. Grazes are not possible in opposed checks. For example: two characters want to compare physical ability and engage in an arm wrestling contest. They will both make athletics checks, with the character rolling highest winning the arm wrestle.

#### Challenge Difficulty

Challenges exist at various difficulties represented by a name and a value. The names of these difficulties can be used as a rough metric for determining the difficulty of any challenge, most of which will exist within the *easy* to *challenging* difficulty range. Anything considered a difficulty of *ambitious* or harder is much rarer.

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty<br/>Value | Difficulty Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 5 | Easy |
| 10 | Moderate |
| 15 | Hard |
| 20 | Challenging |
| 25 | Ambitious |
| 30 | Absurd |
| 40 | Improbable |
<!--| 50 | Impossible |-->

Given a roll against any difficulty value, there are multiple possible outcomes: *failure*, *graze*, *success*, or *critical success*. When you match or exceed the difficulty value, you succeed. Other outcomes depend on how far away you are from the difficulty value. Rolling 10 or more above the difficulty value is a critical success. Rolling below the difficulty is a graze, unless you roll 5 or less below the difficulty, which is a fail. The exact nature of a graze is determined by context and the Game Master: sometimes it is a success with a cost or a failure with a positive benefit. Typically when characters interact, one is rolling to set the difficult value for the other. These two values then create the comparison allowing for varying degrees of successs. For example: A character attacks another and the defender rolls deflection to defend. If the attacker succeeds, they deal full damage, but on a graze they deal half damage.

##### Table: Outcome vs Difficulty
| Difficulty | Fail | Graze | Success | Critical |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| <nobr>10 (Moderate)</nobr> | <nobr>5 or less</nobr> | 6~9 | 10~19 | <nobr>20 or higher</nobr> |
| <nobr>15 (Hard)</nobr> | <nobr>10 or less</nobr> | 11~14 | 15~24 | <nobr>25 or higher</nobr> |
| <nobr>20 (Challenging)</nobr> | <nobr>15 or less</nobr> | 16~19 | 20~29 | <nobr>30 or higher</nobr> |
| <nobr>25 (Ambitious)</nobr> | <nobr>20 or less</nobr> | 21~24 | 25~34 | <nobr>35 or higher</nobr> |

### Skill Duration

While most basic skills and actions can be performed in a matter of a couple seconds, some complex skills and actions cannot be performed so quickly. While it is expected that most complex actions that a character can take (as a result of skill checks) may take at least a few minutes, the exact duration is up to the Game Master based on the circumstances of the skill check. Some actions may even take several hours.
-->

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Occasionally, circumstance, clever roleplaying, or the use of one of your abilities will provide you with *advantage*. For each source of advantage you have to a roll, you may reroll a die of your choice and keep the better result. *Disadvantage* works similarly to advantage, but instead of keeping the better result you must keep the worst result. The die that you reroll when you have disadvantage is the die with the greatest result.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, it would require amount of disadvantage to entirely cancel out.

### Types of Skills

Skills fit into several categories, each one interacting primarily with different parts of the game. *General skills* affect most actions that your character takes in all parts of the game. *Combat skills* and *supernatural skills*, provide more unique benefits depending on the skill and for more niche circumstances. *Languages* are also a skill that a character has, but in most cases player characters will usually all have access to the same base language (called *common*) to simplify player to player communication.

<sup>Click [here](/Appendix/Skills) for the rules for each individual skill.</sup>

#### General Skills

The majority of skills that exist are general skills, each one fulfilling a different niche. Each of the primary stats has their own grouping of three general skills that they work together with, except for strength which one has one: *athletics*. For dexterity, intelligence, and resolve, they have in order: *agility*, *perception*, and *sleight*, then *craft*, *knowledge*, and *medicine*, and finally *charisma*, *contacts*, and *wild empathy*.

#### Combat Skills

Making attacks with a character requires the use of combat skills, all of which use dexterity as their associated stat: *unarmed*, *archery*, *finesse*, and *martial*. Making attacks with higher accuracy requires training, and each combat skill improves different categories of weapons. Some weapons are flexible enough that they can also be used with multiple different combat skills. Combat skills also provide characters with special abilities called *maneuvers*.

<!-- Firearms skills? Light Firearms, Heavy Firearms? -->

#### Supernatural Skills

Supernatural skills represent the ability to perform special abilities outside of the scope of normal physical interactions. This can mean casting spells, psychic projection, or even super hero powers: *animism*, *faith*, *ki*, *sorcery*, and *wizardry*. These types of skills have the most uniquely powerful effects but also the most advanced rules.

<!-- Psionics, Powers -->

#### Languages

When characters are created they are considered native speakers of their starting languages. If any characters wish to learn new languages they will need to acquire them exactly the same way that one would acquire a new complex skill. Therefore, non-native languages have values as roll values. Languages as skills are associated with intelligence.

Whenever your character tries to read, write, speak, or listen to a language that they aren't native in, they will usually need to make a Language check. Once you become a master of that language, it is functionally the same as if you were native in that Language, so you will no longer need to roll to determine success.

## Talents & Other Abilities

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of talents or other special abilities, these aspects of your character are more under you control. Instead you declare exactly what ability you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action. For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* which may require you to roll an athletics check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

Talents are acquired similar to skills, but rather than being represented by a roll value and used with an associated stat, talents are just a special ability. Their entire function is encompassed by what you can do with them or how they modify the overall function of your character.
