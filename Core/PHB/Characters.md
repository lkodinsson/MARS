Characters are made up of several parts, such as stats and skills, which allow them to interact with the game world. 

# Primary Stats

Each character has four Primary Stats that are used to derive other stats and abilities. These stats are: *strength*, *dexterity*, *intelligence*, and *resolve*. All primary stats are represented by roll values usually ranging from r8 to r20.

##### Table: Primary Stat Steps
| Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| r8 | Below Average |
| r10 | Average |
| r12 | Above Average |
| r14 | Great |
| r16 | Superb |
| r18 | Powerful |
| r20 | Epic |

Characters typically start with stats ranging from below average (r8) to above average (r12).

### Strength (STR)

Strength measures physical power, and general vitality. This stat is important for atheletes, labourers, and those who engage in physical contests.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity measures the reaction speed, balance, and precision of your character. It is an important stat for characters who want to be stealthy, perform sleight of hand, tinker with devices, or make attacks.

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons, is for those who want to understand how complex things work, speak many languages, or recall important information. In genres that have magic it also determines a character's capacity for magical energies.

### Resolve (RES)

Resolve is the determination, intuition, and spirituality of your character. It is primarily used for characters who want to persevere through pure force of will, practice the arts or business, or communicate effectively with others.

# Secondary Stats

Characters have several secondary stats: *health*, *endurance*, *stamina*, *focus*, *initiative*, *armour rating*, *damage reduction*, *deflection*, *evasion*, *fortitude*, *willpower*, *speed*, and *size*. These stats are typically calculated based on your primary stats. Armour rating and damage reduction are determined by what your character is wearing, while *speed* and *size* are determined by your character's ancestry.

The first four of the secondary stats (health, endurance, stamina, and focus) are also considered *resources*. Resources have current and maximum values, and they may be spent or damaged.

##### Table: Secondary Stats
| Secondary Stat | Formula |
|:-|:-:|
| Health (HP) | Max STR |
| Endurance (ED) | Max RES |
| Stamina (ST) | Max DEX |
| Focus (FP) | Max INT |
| Initiative (INIT) | DEX + RES |
| Deflection (DEF) | RES + AR |
| Evasion (EVA) | DEX + AR |
| Fortitude (FORT) | STR + RES |
| Willpower (WILL) | INT + RES |

For example: if you have a strength of r12, then you have a maximum strength of 12 and therefore 12 health.

### Health (HP)

Health, or hit points, are an abstraction representing how healthy a character is at the current moment. Any damage taken to your health represents a serious injury.

### Endurance (ED)

Endurance represents your ability to shrug off potential injuries before suffering serious damage, and is easy to restore with a little rest.

### Stamina (ST)

Stamina is used to perform tricks, maneuvers, and certain physical actions.

### Focus (FP)

Focus is used to use powers, cast spells, and perform special abilities.

### Initiative (INIT)

Initiative is your ability to react first in a moment of conflict, and in other rare circumstances.

### Armour Rating (AR)

Armour rating represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to neutralize incoming attacks. This stat is directly applied to your deflection and evasion.

### Damage Reduction (DR)

Damage reduction represents the effectiveness of defensive equipment to reduce the force of incoming successful hits. Any damage you take is reduced by your total damage reduction.

### Deflection (DEF)

Deflection is the capacity to shrug off incoming attacks and abilities before they can even take effect. The use of deflection is often done automatically if no other type of defense is appropriate.

### Evasion (EVA)

Evasion is your ability to quickly avoid danger, rather than relying on deflection to take hits. The use of evasion is often done intentionally rather than automatically relying on other forms of defense.

### Fortitude (FORT)

Fortitude is your ability to resist poison and disease, and many forms of elemental damage like ice and fire. In dire circumstances it is also used to avoid potential death.

### Willpower (WILL)

Willpower is your ability to resist temptation or supernatural influence, both mental and physical. This is not the same as preventing effects that harm the body, but instead those that control the body or mind. Similarly it allows you to judge whether or not someone seems believable. When casting spells it determines the strength of that spell's effect.

### Speed (SPD)

Your speed is a measurement of your average walking distance over six seconds. You can run three times this distance in the same amount of time. This stat also effects other forms of travel, like climbing, swimming, and flying if able. Usually these are performed at half your speed without if you do not have special abilities that state otherwise.

### Size (SZ)

Size is measured in size categories. Most characters will normally be considered medium-sized, however, certain genres may provide you with additional options for playing in different size categories. Your size may provide you with modifiers to some of your other stats.

##### Table: Size & Size Modifiers
| Size | Avg. Height | Avg. Weight | Strength | Dexterity | Speed |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Tiny | ½m~¾m | 5kg~15kg | -3 | +2 | -1 |
| Very Small | ¾m~1m | 15kg~30kg | -2 | +1 | -1 |
| Small | 1m~1½m | 30kg~60kg | -1 | +1 | - |
| Medium | 1½m~2m | 40kg~90kg | - | - | - |
| Large | 2m~2½m | 60kg~150kg | +1 | -1 | - |
| Very Large | 2½m~3m | 90kg~250kg | +2 | -1 | +1 |
| Huge | 3m~4m | 150kg~500kg | +3 | -2 | +1 |

# Skills

Skills represent practice in various physical and mental abilities and are what make certain types of actions easier to perform. Like primary stats, skill values are represented by roll values. All skills have associated primary stats that are rolled with that skill whenever it is performed (listed next to that skill's name). Rolling dice to determine the outcome of a skill is called a skill check.

##### Table: Skill Steps
| Roll Value | Step Name |
|:-:|:-|
| - | Untrained |
| r4 | Trained |
| r6 | Adept |
| r8 | Practiced |
| r10 | Proficient |
| r12 | Exceptional |
| r14 | Disciplined |
| r16 | Accomplished |
| r18 | Expert |
| r20 | Master |

## Skill Checks

If you have taken an action and success is not guaranteed, you will need to make a *skill check*. To do so you will roll your skill and associated primary stat together and compare the result to a *difficulty value* determined secretly by the Game Master. The result of any skill check is determined by its relationship to the difficulty value. This can result in varying degrees of success or failure.

For example: you attempt to leap over a large pit. This requires an athletics check, which is associated with your strength stat. If you have a strength of r12, and an athletics of r4, you will roll r16. If you were not trained in athletics you would still at least roll your strength of r12.

Given a roll against any difficulty value, there are multiple possible outcomes: *failure*, *graze*, *success*, or *critical success*. When you match or exceed the difficulty, you succeed. Other outcomes depend on how far away you are from the difficulty value. Rolling at least 7 above the difficulty value is a critical success. Rolling below the difficulty is a graze, unless you roll at least 7 below the difficulty, which is a fail. The exact nature of a graze is determined by context and the Game Master: sometimes it is a success with a cost, or a failure with a positive benefit.

Some circumstances may require a contest between two sources, such as an attacker against a defender. These are called *opposed checks* as both sides are comparing their skills. In cases where one is simply creating a difficulty value for the other, all things function as normal.

For example: A character attacks another and the defender rolls deflection to defend. If the attacker succeeds, they deal full damage, but on a graze they deal half damage.

For other types of opposed checks where only one side can win (such as an arm wrestling contest), any comparisons that result in anything other than a tie will determine one winner and one loser. Grazes are not possible in this type of opposed check.

### Challenge Difficulty

Various challenges will come at various difficulties. These difficulties are represented by a name and a value. Most challenges requiring you to roll dice will exist within the *moderate* to *ambitious* difficulty range (although more difficult challenges may present themselves) as described by the following table:

##### Table: Challenge Difficulties
| Difficulty<br/>Value | Difficulty Name |
|:-:|:-|
| 5 | Easy |
| 10 | Moderate |
| 15 | Hard |
| 20 | Challenging |
| 25 | Ambitious |
| 30 | Absurd |
| 40 | Improbable |

Below is a visualization of what you need to roll to meet various success thresholds for each difficulty value:

##### Table: Outcome vs Difficulty
| Difficulty | Fail | Graze | Success | Critical |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| <nobr>10 (Moderate)</nobr> | 3 or less | 4~9 | 10~16 | 17 or higher |
| <nobr>15 (Hard)</nobr> | 8 or less | 9~14 | 15~21 | 22 or higher |
| <nobr>20 (Challenging)</nobr> | 13 or less | 14~19 | 20~26 | 27 or higher |
| <nobr>25 (Ambitious)</nobr> | 18 or less | 19~24 | 25~31 | 32 or higher |

### Skill Duration

While most basic skills and actions can be performed in a matter of a couple seconds, some complex skills and actions cannot be performed so quickly. While it is expected that most complex actions that a character can take (as a result of skill checks) may take at least a few minutes, the exact duration is up to the Game Master based on the circumstances of the skill check. Some actions may even take several hours.

### Advantage & Disadvantage

Occasionally, circumstance, clever roleplaying, or one of your abilities will provide you with advantage. For each source of advantage you have to a roll, you may reroll a die of your choice and keep the better result.

Disadvantage works similarly to advantage, but instead of keeping the better result you must keep the worst result. The die that you reroll when you have disadvantage is the die with the greatest result.

Paired instances of advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out. If you have multiple sources granting advantage, it would require just as many sources of disadvantage to entirely cancel out.

### Group Actions

Sometimes multiple players will want to perform the same type of action. In this case, they will all roll the same skill check for that action, but only the best (or worst depending on the circumstance) result will be used.

### Talents & Special Abilities

Under normal circumstances you will dictate what you do rather than specifying the exact game action you take. In the case of talents or other special abilities, however, these aspects of your character are more under you control. In this circumstance it is more appropriate to declare exactly what you are using, and then describe what your character does as it performs that action.

For example: You might say, *"I jump across the pit,"* and you would need to roll an athletics check to succeed. Alternatively, you could instead say, *"I cast Feather Fall then jump across the pit,"* and it might make it easy enough that you don't need to roll at all.

## Basic Skills

All characters can perform all basic skills, even if they are not trained in them. There are five basic skills: *agility*, *athletics*, *charisma*, *knowledge*, and *perception*.

### Agility (DEX)

Light and fast movement are the work of agility. This skill allows you to perform dives, flips, walk silently, hide in dark areas, and squeeze into tight spaces.

### Athletics (STR)

You use the strength of your body to manipulate the world around you and move within it. Athletics includes lifting, climbing, swimming, and jumping, among other physical activities.

### Charisma (RES)

The capacity to convince others to follow your lead, whether that means through intimidation, deception, or appealing to emotion. The use of charisma is not limited to coercing others to follow your lead, it also includes the effort to get others to appeal to your genuine interest.

### Knowledge (INT)

Knowledge represents your ability to recall information. It can be anything from the widely available to the potentially unknown, such as historical events, people, or organizations to secret societies, or the occult. Primarly this skill is used to recall information linked to your character's background and other skills. Recalling information outside your character's expertise is much more difficult. This skill can also be used to make effective work studying new topics, with difficulty depending on your level of familiarity.

### Perception (DEX)

Perception is used to track animals, monsters, or people, to detect stealthy individuals, or find hidden secrets and traps. This skill covers the use of all major senses. Even if one sense is limited, it may still be possible to use your other senses to make up for it. 

## Complex Skills

Unlike basic skills, a character must be at least trained in an complex skill to use it unless their ancestry or background provides a bonus to that skill. Some additional genres provide their own complex skills, but regardless of genre there are five main complex skills: *contacts*, *craft*, *medicine*, *sleight*, and *wild empathy*. All additional types of skills, such as combat skills, spellcasting skills, and even languages are also considered complex skills.

### Contacts (RES)

Sometimes you just know someone who can get what you need done, and if you don't, maybe you know how to find one. In a city or town there's always that somebody. This skill can be used to find people in urban areas where tracking them with perception can't get the job done. It is likely that this task may involve bribes or threats. This skill may even used to determine if you already have an existing rapport with newly introduced non-player characters.

### Craft (INT)

Adventurers may often find themselves in unexpected situations. Crafting can allow for the improvisational construction of traps and tools, for tying strong knots, and even the repair of damaged items. While not necessarily a craft itself, it can even be used to appraise the quality of goods and equipment, or learn how to use unrecognizable equipment.

This skill can also be used to make higher quality custom equipment. When doing so, it will require that you have a toolkit dedicated to the type of craft work you want to pursue (or a workshop containing those tools), and most importantly, a background, archetype, or other form of skillset that relates to the type of items you are crafting. If you do not possess some measure of these things, you can always work together with other characters.

### Medicine (INT)

This skill is important for anyone seeking to apply medicines and treat wounds, injuries, or illnesses. It can also be used to recognize materials, chemicals, and plants with medicinal properties, and recall information on medicines and herbs.

### Sleight (DEX)

Whether its traps, locks, pockets, or just fancy tricks, all such things are within your grasp. While this skill is generally used for everything a thief would do, it can also be used to conceal objects and perform tricks. This skill is also used to construct disguises for to hiding in plain sight.

### Wild Empathy (RES)

In the wild, many animals are unfriendly or fearful towards the majority of people. This skill allows you to speak to and calm down such animals. It can also be used to convince certain animals, like guard dogs, that you are friendly much in the same way you could use charisma to persuade someone.

While this skill does not provide the ability to understand animals directly, it does provide the ability to share in confidence and trust, and to form an emotional bond with animals. Some animals that spend lots of time around people, like cats and dogs, are also capable of responding to very simple spoken requests once this trust is assured. The types of animals who don't, might respond to simple gestures that can signal basic requests.

## Combat Skills

There are four main combat skills: *finesse*, *martial*, *ranged*, and *unarmed*. Attacks can be made with any weapon by rolling your dexterity to hit with those weapons. Making attacks with higher accuracy requires training, and each combat skill improves different categories of weapons. Some weapons can be used by multiple skills, which are called cross-skill weapons.

### Finesse (DEX)

Combat with small or precise weapons. This skill is dedicated to utilizing fast attacks to constantly threaten opponents and find openings and weak spots.

### Martial (DEX)

Combat with heavy or broad weapons. Although it is not as likely to get as many good strikes on an opponent as someone trained in Finesse, it is more likely to deliever stronger blows even without striking the weak points as martial weapons are generally heavier.

### Ranged (DEX)

Ranged combat includes the use of all weapons that involve projectiles, such as bows, guns, and throwing weapons.

### Unarmed (DEX)

Unarmed combat involves anything from complex martial arts to boxing. Unarmed combat is the least likely to deal lethal blows, but is important for anyone who might find themselves often fighting without a weapon.

## Supernatural Skills

### Animism (RES)

### Faith (RES)

### Ki

### Sorcery (RES)

### Wizardry (INT)

## Languages

When characters are created they are considered native speakers of their starting languages. If any characters wish to learn new languages they will need to acquire them exactly the same way that one would acquire a new complex skill. Therefore, non-native languages have values as roll values. Languages as skills are associated with intelligence.

Whenever your character tries to read, write, speak, or listen to a language that they aren't native in, they will usually need to make a Language check. Once you become a master of that language, it is functionally the same as if you were native in that Language, so you will no longer need to roll to determine success.

The availability of languages to your character are determined by the genre that you are in. Usually there is a "common" language that all characters speak, with individual languages for some subgroups. In the fantasy genre it is common for most monstrous creatures to also share an "outsider" language between them.
