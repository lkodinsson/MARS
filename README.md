# What is MARS?

**MARS** or **Modular Adventure Role-playing System** is a [generic role-playing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_role-playing_game_system). One player (the *Game Master* or GM) describes the events that occur, while the other players (the *characters*) describe the actions they take. Difficult actions may require dice rolls to determine their success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Many roleplaying games typically use [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) to describe what dice to roll, while MARS uses a modified version of dice notation called [roll value](/Core/PHB.md#roll-value). MARS can be played in various genres, and has optional variant rules to suit your group's playstyle.

# Learning to Play

All of the cores rules are defined in the [**Player's Handbook**](/Core/PHB). Additional information and reference tables can be found in the [**Appendix**](/Core/Appendix).

Once you have learned the rules and are ready to create a character, you will need to follow the steps as outlined in [**Creating a Character**](/Core/PHB#creating-a-character). In the sidebar there are links to various sources of information such as character ancestries, backgrounds, and archtypes.
