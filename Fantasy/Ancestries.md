## Orc

Known for their size and muscular structure, orcs they are often mistakenly labelled as brutes. While their strength is true, they are just as varied and capable as other races.

Within their race, mycelians communicate telepathically with one another, and some individuals also learn sign language to more easily converse with other races.

**Grit** Mycelians get a +1 bonus to maximum endurance, stamina, and focus.

**Size** Mycelians can be small, medium, or large sized, but are typically medium sized.
